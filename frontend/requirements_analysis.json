The Finnish regulation (30) operationalizes this by requiring documented procedures for identifying such concentrations. They are all compatible and address the same risk from different regulatory levels."

This asymmetric approach, where an asset is derecognized but a liability is fully counted, conflicts with the neutral net-balance approach of accounting.
