PARAGRAPH_33587: (4) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, transactions are deemed to be of the same class where they belong to subgroups a-m listed in section 4.1, paragraph 3. Where transactions are related to each other in such a way that they can be considered a single transaction, the combined value of the transactions is assessed against the reporting threshold. Whether transactions are related to each other is assessed both temporally and qualitatively.

PARAGRAPH_33588: (5) The FIN-FSA may, at the request of the obliged entity, raise the reporting threshold referred to in paragraph 1, if the EUR 1 million threshold is unnecessarily low relative to the size of the group.
