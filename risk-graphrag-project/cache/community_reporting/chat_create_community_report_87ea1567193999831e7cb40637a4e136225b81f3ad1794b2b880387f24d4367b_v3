These regulations are primarily guided by the 'ACT ON TRADING IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS', a key piece of Finnish legislation governing financial markets. This act mandates that exchanges must notify the FIN-FSA about their outsourcing plans for material functions. The regulatory oversight ensures that even when activities are outsourced, transparency and accountability are maintained through necessary information sharing with the supervisory authority [Data: Entities (710, 692, 667); Relationships (1503, 1409)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Requirements for Outsourcing Partners\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Exchanges are obligated to ensure that their chosen outsourcing partners meet stringent criteria. These partners must possess adequate resources, competence, financial capacity, and expertise to effectively carry out the outsourced tasks. Furthermore, exchanges must have established procedures to continuously assess the performance of these outsourcing partners. This ensures that the quality and reliability of outsourced services are maintained at a high standard [Data: Entities (704, 705, 716, 718, 719); Relationships (1514, 1515, 1543, 1544)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Contingency Planning and Disruption Management\",\n      \"explanation\": \"A critical aspect of outsourcing material activities for exchanges involves robust contingency planning. Exchanges must develop plans that specifically address potential disruptions that could arise from outsourced services. This includes ensuring that their contingency plans provide for such disruptions, thereby minimizing the impact on operations and maintaining service continuity. The 'ACT ON TRADING IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS' implicitly supports this through its emphasis on regulatory supervision and information sharing, which would be compromised by unmanaged disruptions [Data: Entities (720, 721); Relationships (1525, 1516, 1545)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Confidentiality and Internal Competence\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The regulations place a strong emphasis on safeguarding sensitive information. Outsourcing partners are required to protect the confidentiality of data pertaining to the supervised entity and its customers from any unauthorized disclosure. Concurrently, exchanges must retain 'key areas of competence' internally. This means that while certain functions can be outsourced, the exchange must maintain essential skills and knowledge in-house to effectively oversee and manage these outsourced activities [Data: Entities (722, 723); Relationships (1547, 1527)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Exclusion of Regulated Market Operations from Outsourcing Rules\",\n      \"explanation\": \"While the FIN-FSA's regulations on outsourcing are comprehensive for exchanges, they specifically exclude the direct operation of a 'regulated market' itself. This means that the core functions of a marketplace where financial instruments are traded under regulatory frameworks are not subject to the same outsourcing conditions as other material activities an exchange might undertake. This distinction ensures that the primary trading venue remains under the direct control and management of the exchange [Data: Entities (715, 692); Relationships (1518)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Exchange as a Financial Institution\",\n      \"explanation\": \"In the context of these regulations, an exchange is recognized as a type of financial institution.
