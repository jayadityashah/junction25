These entities represent the core organizations whose financial reporting is being regulated. Sickness funds are described as having an associated data collection for income statements and balance sheets, known as KA-tiedonkeruu [Data: Entities (314)]. Similarly, unemployment funds have a corresponding data collection referred to as KB-tiedonkeruu [Data: Entities (315)]. The degree of these entities suggests their foundational importance within this regulatory context [Data: Entities (313, 170, 314, 315)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Regulatory Amendments through Paragraphs\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Two key paragraphs, PARAGRAPH_59552 and PARAGRAPH_59549, are central to the regulatory changes within this community [Data: Entities (321, 318)]. PARAGRAPH_59552 is particularly significant as it directly added the income statement and balance sheet requirements (KA-tiedonkeruu and KB-tiedonkeruu) to Table 2 [Data: Entities (321)]. PARAGRAPH_59549, while also part of Finnish regulations, expanded the scope of Chapter 1 to include these funds [Data: Entities (318)].

PARAGRAPH_59552 is directly linked to both KA-tiedonkeruu and KB-tiedonkeruu, signifying its role in mandating these specific financial reports [Data: Relationships (666, 667)]. This paragraph's addition of these data points to Table 2 is a concrete regulatory action.

These relationships, with degrees of 6 and 7 respectively, underscore the specific focus of these data requirements on each type of fund [Data: Relationships (660, 663)].
