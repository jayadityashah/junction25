These entities must submit various types of data, including basic data on transactions (labeled a through g), pricing, and interest rates [Data: Entities (972, 994, 995)]. The reporting is often conducted using specific formats such as S tables and the LTC table [Data: Entities (417, 418), Relationships (830, 985, 999, 1000)].

The LTC table is the primary method for submitting supervisory information related to consumer credits, including the LTC ratio [Data: Entities (418), Relationships (997)]. Specific columns within the LTC table have distinct reporting requirements regarding the sign and format of the data [Data: Entities (504, 505, 506), Relationships (1058, 1059, 1060)].
