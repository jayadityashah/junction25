These entities operate under various acts, including those related to credit institutions and financial instruments. The FIN-FSA mandates that supervised entities report material changes in their contractual relationships with outsourcing partners. The scope of 'supervised entity' is broad, encompassing all entities and foreign branches within the purview of specific regulations and guidelines, as defined by the Act on the Financial Supervisory Authority [Data: Entities (438), Relationships (875, 958, 959, 962, 963, 964, 1132, 1133, 1692, 1697, 1707, 1747)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Comprehensive Outsourcing Agreement Requirements\",\n      \"explanation\": \"A significant focus within this community is on the detailed requirements for outsourcing agreements. These agreements are crucial for material activities and must explicitly include operational goals for outsourcing, the process for selecting and monitoring outsourcing partners, and safeguarding the continuity of outsourced activities. Specific clauses are mandated, such as the outsourcing partner's duty to inform of disruptions, their right to transfer tasks, secrecy obligations, and contingency planning for information systems and security. Furthermore, agreements must address applicable legislation and dispute resolution for cross-border outsourcing [Data: Entities (838, 791, 799, 801, 807, 808, 809, 811, 812, 815, 816, 817, 822, 826, 829, 830, 831, 832, 833, 835, 839), Relationships (1754, 1757, 1760, 1762, 1764, 1768, 1783)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Risk Management in Outsourcing\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Supervised entities are obligated to manage risks associated with outsourcing effectively.
