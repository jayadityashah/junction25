It defines 'Obliged Entities' subject to its regulations and guidelines, specifically 'FINANCIAL_REGULATION 1/2014'. The FIN-FSA mandates reporting on the state of the banking system, with specific deadlines including the 15th of May, August, and November, and the end of February for quarterly reports. Reports are to be submitted in a 'FREE FORMAT', and the FIN-FSA has the authority to raise a monetary threshold of EUR 1 million under certain conditions.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"FIN-FSA as the Central Regulatory Authority\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The FIN-FSA Financial Supervisory Authority is the core entity in this community, acting as Finland's official regulatory body for the financial sector. Its primary role is to oversee and supervise financial institutions and enforce regulations to ensure stability and integrity within the financial industry [Data: Entities (402)]. The FIN-FSA issues regulations and guidelines, such as 'FINANCIAL_REGULATION 1/2014', which define the scope of application for supervised entities [Data: Relationships (880), Entities (963)].

These entities are defined as those falling within the scope of application of the regulations and guidelines issued by the FIN-FSA [Data: Entities (963)]. The relationship between 'FINANCIAL_REGULATION' and 'OBLIGED_ENTITY' highlights that these entities are directly subject to the rules set forth by the authority, indicating a broad reach of regulatory oversight [Data: Relationships (2106)].

The FIN-FSA has established specific deadlines for these reports, including the 15th day of May, August, and November for quarterly submissions, and the end of February for the final quarter's report [Data: Relationships (2242), Relationships (2243)].

The relationship between the FIN-FSA and 'FREE FORMAT' suggests that while the content and timeliness are critical, the specific presentation can be adapted by the reporting entities [Data: Relationships (2241)].
