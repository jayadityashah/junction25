It dictates the operational framework, responsibilities, and obligations for these entities. This Act specifically addresses crucial aspects such as outsourcing of material activities and the requirements for representatives acting on behalf of payment institutions. It ensures that regulatory bodies, like the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority (FIN-FSA), have oversight over these institutions' operations. The Act also covers provisions for information sharing necessary for supervision and mandates customer information disclosure.

These include the proper functioning of risk management and internal control systems, which are critical for supervised entities. Furthermore, any representatives acting on behalf of a payment institution must meet specific criteria. These criteria include possessing 'good repute,' indicating trustworthiness and ethical conduct, and being 'qualified to conduct the activities,' meaning they have the necessary skills and knowledge for the payment services they provide. The Act also stipulates that the issuance of electronic money cannot be entirely outsourced to a representative.

The Ministry of Finance Decree on the Accounts to be Appended to the Application for Authorisation of a Payment Institution (1040/2017) specifies the financial documentation required for authorization, further ensuring a thorough vetting process.
