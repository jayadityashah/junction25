Their duties extend to overseeing outsourced functions related to fund unit registers and employing representatives to execute these investment activities [Data: Entities (639, 772), Relationships (1642,+more)].

Management Companies can manage registers of Finnish unit holders directly, while the registry of foreign unit holders can be outsourced [Data: Entities (789), Relationships (1673, 1683, 1684)]. Importantly, Management Companies must retain the authority to execute subscription and redemption orders, which includes the registration process within these unit registers, even when the overall maintenance is outsourced [Data: Relationships (1673, 1685, 1686)].

Furthermore, their investment activities must be conducted in strict compliance with both mutual fund rules and investment policy agreements [Data: Relationships (1670, 1671)]. The Mutual Funds Act also plays a crucial role, particularly concerning outsourcing provisions, where any agreement transferring a management company's responsibilities to a third party is deemed invalid [Data: Entities (780, 785), Relationships (1639, 1651)].
