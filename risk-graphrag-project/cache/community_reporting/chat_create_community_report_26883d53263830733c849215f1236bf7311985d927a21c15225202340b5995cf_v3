These partners are defined as third-party providers engaged by supervised entities for material activities. They are subject to stringent requirements, including possessing adequate 'FINANCIAL CAPACITY' and 'EXPERTISE' [Data: Entities (716, 718, 719), Relationships (1543, 1544)]. The emphasis on these attributes underscores the importance of selecting and managing outsourcing partners carefully to ensure the reliability and quality of outsourced services.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Importance of Contingency Planning for Outsourced Services\",\n      \"explanation\": \"'CONTINGENCY PLANNING' is identified as a crucial process, with a degree of 2.
