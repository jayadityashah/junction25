COREP reports, with a degree of 1, are specifically mentioned as a source of supervisory information for interest rate risk, which falls under the umbrella of market risk. The relationships indicate that FIN-FSA standard RA4.5 pertains to market risk reporting, and COREP reports are used for the supervision of market risk.
