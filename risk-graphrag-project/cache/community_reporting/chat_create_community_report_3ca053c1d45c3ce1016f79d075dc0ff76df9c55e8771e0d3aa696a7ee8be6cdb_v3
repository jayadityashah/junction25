This law explicitly mandates the supervision of various entities, including insurance companies (VAKUUTUSYHTIÖLAISSA TARKKOITETTU VAKUUTUSYHTIÖ), occupational pension companies (TYÖELÄKEVAKUUTUSYHTIÖISTÄ ANNETUSSA LAISSA TARKKOITETTU TYÖELÄKEVAKUUTUSYHTIÖ), pension foundations (ELÄKESÄÄTIÖISTÄ JA ELÄKEKASSOISTA ANNETUSSA LAISSA TARKKOITETTU ELÄKESÄÄTIÖ), pension funds (ELÄKESÄÄTIÖISTÄ JA ELÄKEKASSOISTA ANNETUSSA LAISSA TARKKOITETTU ELÄKEKASSA), and supplementary pension funds (LISÄELÄKESÄÄTIÖISTÄ JA LISÄELÄKEKASSOISTA ANNETUSSA LAISSA TARKKOITETTU LISÄELÄKEKASSA) [Data: Entities (34), Relationships (115, 116, 120)]. This indicates a centralized oversight body responsible for ensuring compliance and stability within these critical financial sectors. The high combined degree of these relationships (8 and 9) suggests the significant importance of this law in defining the operational boundaries and accountability of these entities.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Key Entities within the Finnish Pension System\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Finnish pension system is characterized by several distinct entities, each defined by specific legislation.

These entities play a crucial role in providing retirement benefits and are subject to regulations that ensure their solvency and proper management.

This suggests that the implementation law dictates how certain financial entities, likely those dealing with insurance or health funds, are to be structured into departments or divisions. The relationship between this implementation law and the specific sections, along with its associated timeline of March 31, 2022, underscores its importance in defining internal organizational compliance [Data: Relationships (133)].
