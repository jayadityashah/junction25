Key activities include extensive data collection from supervised entities, setting solvency limits, and imposing penalties for non-compliance.

It is the official regulatory body responsible for overseeing Finland's financial sector, ensuring stability, and enforcing financial regulations [Data: Entities (3)]. The FIN-FSA's extensive involvement is evident through its high degree (72) and its relationships with numerous other entities and concepts related to regulation and data collection [Data: Entities (3), Relationships (5, 9, 148, 1998, 541, 443, 438, 514, 535, 536, 543, 554, 557)].

The FIN-FSA also specifies reporting levels and uses identifier tables to manage this data collection effectively [Data: Entities (251, 252), Relationships (433, 434)].
