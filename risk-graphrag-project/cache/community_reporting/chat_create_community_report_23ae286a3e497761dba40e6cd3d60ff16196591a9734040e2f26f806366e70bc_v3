Its significance is underscored by its definition within the Credit Institutions Act (610/2014) and its detailed regulatory treatment. The LTV is not merely a descriptive term but a regulated requirement, indicating its importance in financial stability and borrower assessment [Data: Entities (440); Relationships (877)].\\n\\nThe LTV is defined as the loan amount granted in relation to the current value of the collateral security lodged at the time of origination. This metric is crucial for assessing the risk associated with a loan, as a higher LTV implies a greater risk for the lender. The regulatory focus on this ratio suggests a proactive approach to managing potential financial instability within the credit market.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Regulatory Framework and Key Documents\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The regulatory framework governing the LTV is established through various official documents and sections. 'REGULATION AND GUIDELINE 3/2015 CALCULATION OF LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO' by FIN-FSA is a primary source dictating calculation methods [Data: Entities (491)]. This regulation is further detailed and implemented through specific sections of broader regulatory documents. For instance, SECTION 4.1 has been updated to include reporting requirements for the LTV, encompassing submission and content of borrower data [Data: Entities (579)].\\n\\nAdditionally, SECTION 1.2 provides the definition for the LTV, and SECTION 3 outlines the objectives for reporting on this ratio. These sections collectively form a comprehensive set of rules and guidelines that financial institutions must adhere to.

Prior to this, the regulations themselves were issued on '9 MARCH 2016', establishing the timeline for institutions to prepare for compliance [Data: Entities (589); Relationships (1255)].\\n\\nThese dates are crucial for supervised entities as they delineate the period for adopting new reporting standards and calculation methods.

The detailed requirements for reporting, including the objectives and content of the data, are specified in various sections of the regulatory documents, such as SECTION 3 and SECTION 4.1 [Data: Entities (579), Entities (598)].\\n\\nThis obligation ensures that regulatory bodies have access to consistent and relevant information for monitoring the financial health of lending institutions and the broader market.
