The FIN-FSA, a key regulatory body, issues regulations and guidelines that govern various financial activities, including intra-group transactions, services produced within a group, cost-sharing agreements, and ordinary payments. The Credit Institutions Act is a foundational piece of legislation, detailing reporting obligations for credit institutions, particularly concerning intra-group transactions and outsourcing. Holding companies, EEA insurance companies, and other undertakings within the same group as credit institutions are also subject to FIN-FSA's supervision.

Its authority to issue regulations is derived from and limited by legal provisions [Data: Entities (399)]. The FIN-FSA issues both regulations and guidelines, which are binding legal requirements [Data: Entities (954), Relationships (797)]. It plays a crucial role in ensuring compliance and managing risks within the financial sector by requiring information from supervised entities [Data: Entities (242)]. The FIN-FSA's supervisory scope includes domestic banks, legal issues in banking supervision, and digitalization in banking services [Data: Relationships (785, 2074, 1281)].\\n\\nThe FIN-FSA's regulatory power is extensive, covering a wide array of financial activities and entities. Its role is critical in maintaining the stability and integrity of the Finnish financial system.

This act defines credit institutions and outlines their operational requirements, including significant reporting obligations [Data: Entities (433)]. Notably, Chapter 5, Section 15 of the act specifically addresses reporting requirements for intra-group transactions [Data: Entities (433), Relationships (918, 2229, 1026)].\\n\\nFurthermore, the CREDIT INSTITUTIONS ACT governs outsourcing plans for credit institutions, detailing requirements for material changes in contractual relationships with outsourcing partners [Data: Entities (433)]. It also sets regulations for consumer credits and loan-to-value ratios, preventing credit institutions from exceeding prescribed limits on residential mortgage loans [Data: Entities (433)]. The act also specifies reporting requirements for various entities within the same group as a credit institution, including undertakings referred to in the Accounting Act, pension foundations, pension funds, and supplementary pension funds [Data: Relationships (2146, 2147, 2148, 2149, 2150, 2151)].

These include intra-group transactions, services produced internally, agreements to share costs, and agreements on the management of companies within a group [Data: Entities (986, 987, 988, 989)]. Ordinary payments are also subject to these regulations [Data: Entities (990)].\\n\\nThe CREDIT INSTITUTIONS ACT explicitly mandates reporting for intra-group transactions for credit institutions [Data: Entities (433), Relationships (2146)]. This focus suggests a regulatory concern with potential risks associated with internal dealings, such as transfer pricing issues or the movement of capital within a group, which could impact the financial health of individual entities and the group as a whole.

This inclusion highlights the cross-border regulatory cooperation and the FIN-FSA's role in supervising entities that operate within Finland but may be headquartered elsewhere in the European Economic Area.

This stipulation is a critical component of the regulatory framework, aimed at maintaining oversight even when functions are delegated to third parties.\\n\\nThe regulation of outsourcing is a significant aspect of financial supervision, as it allows credit institutions to streamline operations but also introduces potential risks.
