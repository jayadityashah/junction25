The FIN-FSA establishes and enforces regulations, guidelines, and legal provisions to ensure the stability and integrity of the financial system. Key entities within this community include credit institutions, payment institutions, exchanges, and holding companies, all of which are subject to FIN-FSA's oversight. A significant focus of FIN-FSA's regulatory activities involves reporting requirements, risk management, internal control, and the conditions surrounding outsourcing of material activities. The legal framework underpinning FIN-FSA's authority is primarily derived from acts such as the Act on the Financial Supervisory Authority, the Credit Institutions Act, and the Payment Institutions Act, with specific decrees and standards also playing a role.\",\n  \"findings\": [\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"The Central Role of the Financial Supervisory Authority (FIN-FSA)\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The Financial Supervisory Authority (FIN-FSA), also known as Finanssivalvonta, is the central regulatory body in Finland, responsible for overseeing financial activities and entities. It possesses significant regulatory powers, including the ability to issue binding regulations, recommendations, and guidelines. The FIN-FSA's mandate includes supervising financial markets and ensuring compliance with financial regulations [Data: Entities (700, 242), Relationships (1488, 1165, 1170)]. The authority acquires crucial information for its supervisory purposes, such as data on credit risk positions and loan-to-value ratios, and has the right to obtain information from supervised entities, their representatives, or service providers [Data: Entities (7), Relationships (1459)]. FIN-FSA plays a key role in managing notifications and reporting requirements, with various entities required to submit specific tables and notifications to the authority [Data: Entities (7), Relationships (898)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Comprehensive Regulatory Framework Governed by FIN-FSA\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The FIN-FSA operates within a robust legal framework that includes various acts and decrees. The Act on the Financial Supervisory Authority empowers FIN-FSA to issue regulations, particularly concerning the provision of information [Data: Entities (448), Relationships (904)]. Other key legislation includes the Credit Institutions Act, which governs credit institutions and mandates reporting obligations, especially concerning intra-group transactions and outsourcing plans [Data: Entities (433), Relationships (433)]. The Payment Institutions Act similarly regulates payment institutions, focusing on outsourcing of material activities and information sharing for supervision [Data: Entities (685), Relationships (1411)]. These acts, along with specific decrees and standards like the Ministry of Finance Decree on the Accounts to be Appended to the Application for Authorisation of a Payment Institution (1040/2017) and FIN-FSA Standards (e.g., RA4.7, RA4.5, RA4.6), form the comprehensive regulatory landscape [Data: Entities (861, 553, 551, 552), Relationships (1838, 1174, 1172, 1173)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Reporting Obligations and Information Requirements for Supervised Entities\",\n      \"explanation\": \"Supervised entities are subject to extensive reporting obligations and information requirements mandated by the FIN-FSA.

This includes information related to risk management, internal control, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, non-performing assets, and largest counterparties [Data: Entities (553, 551, 552, 554), Relationships (1174, 1172, 1175)].

Both credit institutions and payment institutions are required to notify the FIN-FSA of any outsourcing of material activities [Data: Entities (433, 642), Relationships (1503, 1411)]. The FIN-FSA also provides recommendations and sets conditions for outsourcing, including the requirement for outsourcing contracts to include specific clauses for information access and inspection rights [Data: Entities (7), Relationships (1507)].

Similarly, a 'Definitions' section provides clarity on key terms used within the regulations, which is essential for accurate reporting and adherence to legal requirements [Data: Entities (416), Relationships (819)].
