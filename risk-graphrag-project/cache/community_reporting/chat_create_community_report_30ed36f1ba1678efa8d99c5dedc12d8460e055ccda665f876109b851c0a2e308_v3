The FIN-FSA (Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority) is identified as the primary regulatory body responsible for issuing, amending, and overseeing these regulations [Data: Entities (2), Relationships (60)]. This relationship signifies that the FIN-FSA has significant regulatory powers and actively participates in shaping and enforcing financial regulations in the Finnish jurisdiction. The FIN-FSA's involvement underscores the importance of compliance and the structured approach to managing the financial sector [Data: Relationships (60)].\\n\\nThe scope of FINANCIAL_REGULATION is broad, touching upon numerous aspects of financial operations. This includes reporting obligations for various institutions, specific sections within regulatory documents, and the influence of European Union Directives. The regulation also extends to specific types of transactions and entities, such as leases for real estate, ordinary transactions of real estate companies within groups, and branches of foreign insurance companies [Data: Entities (567, 582, 957, 991, 992, 52), Relationships (1197, 1228, 2083, 2138, 2139, 125)].

These entities, operating within the Finnish jurisdiction, must adhere to the established financial regulations [Data: Relationships (282, 333, 337, 338)].\\n\\nFurthermore, the regulations cover specific operational aspects and transactions. For instance, ordinary market investments, securities intermediation within groups, mutual reinsurance, investments in shares and capital, capital loans, and items eligible for the solvency margin of insurance companies are all encompassed by FINANCIAL_REGULATION [Data: Entities (997, 998, 999, 1000, 1001, 1002), Relationships (2166, 2167, 2168, 2169, 2170, 2171)].

These dates are crucial for understanding the timeline of regulatory compliance and enforcement within the Finnish financial sector.\\n\\nAdditionally, European Union Directives and specific regulations play a significant role. EU Regulation is a source for financial regulations, and specific EU regulations like Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 are directly applicable in the Finnish jurisdiction [Data: Entities (406, 443, 444), Relationships (803, 883, 884)]. The influence of directives such as MiFID II is also noted, as it has led to changes in Finnish financial regulations [Data: Entities (884), Relationships (1931)]. Compliance timelines, such as March 31, 2014, and specific validity dates like '15.6.2023, valid from 1.9.2023' and '23.1.2018, valid from 1.2.2018', further define the operational periods and requirements for financial entities [Data: Entities (610, 689, 690, 696), Relationships (1267, 1398, 1399, 1480)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Outsourcing of activities is a significant area of focus within financial regulation.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"FINANCIAL_REGULATION places considerable emphasis on the outsourcing of various activities.

Furthermore, there are specific requirements regarding the contents of outsourcing notifications and notifications concerning the outsourcing of material activities [Data: Entities (635, 636), Relationships (1300, 1301)]. The FIN-FSA considers internal control and risk management, internal audit, and compliance as material activities in this context [Data: Relationships (1574, 1575, 1576)]. Certain services, such as administrative functions, advisory services, legal services, marketing and advertising services, and the procurement of standardized services, may not be regarded as material from the point of view of outsourcing [Data: Entities (748, 749, 750, 751, 752), Relationships (1591, 1592, 1593, 1594, 1595)].\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"Reporting and supervisory purposes are key objectives of financial regulation.\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The framework of FINANCIAL_REGULATION is closely tied to reporting obligations and supervisory purposes.
