It must clearly define the services or material activities being outsourced, the duration of the contract, and adhere to regulatory requirements. The agreement serves as a critical submission during formal notification processes, highlighting its significance in regulatory compliance. Specific clauses recommended by the FIN-FSA include the outsourcing partner's duty to inform of disruptions, their right to transfer tasks, and their secrecy obligations.
