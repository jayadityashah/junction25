This directive serves as a significant piece of legislation within the European Union, consolidating and updating previous regulatory frameworks. Specifically, Directive 2013/36/EU amends Directive 2002/87/EC and repeals two earlier directives: Directive 2006/48/EC and Directive 2006/49/EC. The primary objective of this directive is to establish a comprehensive framework for the authorization and ongoing supervision of credit institutions and investment firms, ensuring their financial stability and the protection of depositors and investors. It addresses various aspects of their operations, including capital requirements, liquidity management, governance, and risk management. By doing so, Directive 2013/36/EU aims to foster a sound and stable financial sector across the European Union, promoting fair competition and enhancing the resilience of financial markets.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "images": [], "thinking_blocks": []}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 226, "prompt_tokens": 293, "total_tokens": 519, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 293, "image_tokens": null}}, "vertex_ai_grounding_metadata": [], "vertex_ai_url_context_metadata": [], "vertex_ai_safety_results": [], "vertex_ai_citation_metadata": []}}}
