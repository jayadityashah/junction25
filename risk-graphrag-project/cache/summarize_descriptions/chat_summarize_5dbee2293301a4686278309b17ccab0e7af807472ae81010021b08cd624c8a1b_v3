It is recognized as a component and a type of financial regulation, highlighting its integral role in the oversight and management of financial systems. Financial regulation encompasses a wide array of rules, standards, and practices designed to ensure the stability, integrity, and fairness of financial markets and institutions. Within this framework, credit risk specifically addresses the potential for loss arising from a borrower's failure to repay a loan or meet contractual obligations.\n\nFinancial regulators establish guidelines and requirements to manage and mitigate credit risk across various financial entities, including banks, credit unions, and other lending institutions. These regulations often mandate capital adequacy ratios, loan loss provisioning, and risk management practices to absorb potential losses and prevent systemic failures.
