Finanssivalvonta oversees the financial markets in Finland, ensuring their stability and integrity, and the reporting requirement is a key mechanism for them to fulfill this mandate. The specific nature of the reporting, including the types of entities obligated to report, the data to be submitted, and the frequency of these submissions, would be detailed in the relevant Finnish legislation and Finanssivalvonta's regulations.
