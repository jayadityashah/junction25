In parallel, supervised entities are mandated to establish and maintain robust procedures specifically designed for the assessment of their outsourcing partners. This ensures a comprehensive framework where both parties contribute to the integrity and oversight of outsourced operations. The supervised entities' responsibility for assessing their outsourcing partners complements the outsourcing partners' obligation to provide necessary information, creating a system of mutual accountability.
