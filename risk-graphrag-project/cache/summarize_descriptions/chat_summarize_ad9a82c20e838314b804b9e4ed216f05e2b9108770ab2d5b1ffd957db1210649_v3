A key aspect of these recommendations is that supervised entities must guarantee that their outsourcing partners consistently furnish all information essential for official supervision, risk management, and internal control. Furthermore, the FIN-FSA specifically advises payment institutions to mandate that their outsourcing partners establish and maintain robust contingency plans.
