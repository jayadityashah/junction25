A key characteristic of a sub-consolidation group is that its parent undertakings may not be subject to the same reporting obligations as those that apply to a main consolidation group. This distinction implies a tiered structure within consolidation reporting, where certain groups, while integrated into the larger entity, have a different set of regulatory or financial disclosure requirements. Essentially, a sub-consolidation group represents a distinct segment or division within a broader consolidated financial reporting framework, allowing for specialized reporting or a different level of detail for its constituent entities compared to the primary consolidation group.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "images": [], "thinking_blocks": []}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 135, "prompt_tokens": 198, "total_tokens": 333, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 198, "image_tokens": null}}, "vertex_ai_grounding_metadata": [], "vertex_ai_url_context_metadata": [], "vertex_ai_safety_results": [], "vertex_ai_citation_metadata": []}}}
