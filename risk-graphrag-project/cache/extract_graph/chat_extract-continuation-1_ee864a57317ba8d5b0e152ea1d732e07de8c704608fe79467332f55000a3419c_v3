However, based on the provided instructions and the text content, it seems we have covered the primary entities and relationships relevant to the specified entity types. If there are specific details or nuances within the text that have not been directly addressed, it could be due to the limitations in interpreting the provided segments without additional context or specific mentions of other entity types like Compliance Timeline, Severity Level, Industry Sector, Remediation Action, Financial Institution, etc., within the explicitly provided text.\n\nGiven the constraints and the information provided, it appears we have identified the key entities and their relationships based on the available data and the specified entity types. If there are additional details in the text that could be interpreted as fitting the specified entity types but were not explicitly mentioned, it would be beneficial to review the text again with those specific lenses. However, without further specific details or additional text content, it's challenging to add more entities and relationships that accurately fit the requested types and maintain relevance to the provided text segments.\n\nIf there's more text or specific guidance on overlooked details that fit the specified entity types, I'm ready to assist further.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 227, "prompt_tokens": 3734, "total_tokens": 3961, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
