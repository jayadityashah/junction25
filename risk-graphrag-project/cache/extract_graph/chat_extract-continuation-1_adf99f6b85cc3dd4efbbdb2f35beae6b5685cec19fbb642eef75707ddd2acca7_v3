However, without additional specific text content to analyze, it's challenging to identify and add the missed entities and relationships accurately. \n\nThe initial response aimed to cover a broad range of entities related to financial regulation, gender pay gap issues, and the implementation of equitable remuneration policies within the jurisdiction of Finnish financial institutions, as guided by the European Banking Authority (EBA) and under the regulatory frameworks such as the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\n\nIf there were more specific details or additional text provided, it would be possible to further identify missed entities such as specific regulatory requirements, additional legal entities, financial institutions, or other regulatory bodies involved, and more detailed implementation methods or compliance timelines. Additionally, relationships that detail the interaction between these entities, their roles in implementing or complying with the guidelines, and the impact of these regulations on various stakeholders could be further elaborated.\n\nWithout new or additional text to analyze, it's challenging to proceed with further extractions or corrections. The process relies on the content provided to identify entities and relationships accurately. Therefore, in the context of this task and based on the information previously given, it's not feasible to add more entities and relationships without further input or clarification.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 282, "prompt_tokens": 4285, "total_tokens": 4567, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
