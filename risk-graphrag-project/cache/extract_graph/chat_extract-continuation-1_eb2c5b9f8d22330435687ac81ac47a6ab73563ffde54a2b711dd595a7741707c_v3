However, based on the instructions and the data provided earlier, it seems I've reached the limit of my current capabilities to extract and infer additional specific entities and relationships without further context or additional text excerpts. The entities and relationships provided were directly identified from the text based on the entity types specified in the instructions. Without new or additional text data that contains explicit mentions of other entities or relationships fitting the specified types, I'm unable to generate more entities or relationships that adhere to the guidelines provided.\n\nIf there's more text or if you have specific entities or relationships in mind that were mentioned in the text and fit the specified types but were not extracted, please provide that text or those details. Otherwise, based on the current information and guidelines, I cannot proceed further without additional context or clarification.\n\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 167, "prompt_tokens": 3764, "total_tokens": 3931, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
