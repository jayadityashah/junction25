However, based on the provided text and the instructions, it seems we have already extracted the relevant entities and relationships that fit the specified entity types. The text primarily revolves around the regulatory framework provided by the EBA for financial institutions within the Finnish jurisdiction, focusing on sound remuneration policies. Without additional specific text content that introduces new entities fitting the given types (Risk_Category, Regulatory_Requirement, Jurisdiction, Regulatory_Source, Implementation_Method, Compliance_Timeline, Severity_Level, Industry_Sector, Remediation_Action, Legal_Entity, Financial_Institution, Regulatory_Body), it's challenging to add more entities or relationships.\n\nGiven the constraints and the information provided, it appears we have identified the key entities and their relationships based on the entity types listed. If there are specific details or entities within the text that have been overlooked and fit the provided entity types, please provide further guidance or clarification.\n\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 189, "prompt_tokens": 3629, "total_tokens": 3818, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
