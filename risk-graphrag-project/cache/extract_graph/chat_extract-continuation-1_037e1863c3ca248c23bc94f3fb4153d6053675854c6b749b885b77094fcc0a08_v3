However, based on the provided instructions and the text content, it seems we have already extracted the entities and relationships that directly match the specified entity types. The text primarily discusses financial regulations within the Finnish jurisdiction, mentions the regulatory source FIVA_MOK, and identifies the regulatory body FIN-FSA Finanssivalvonta. Without additional specific content from the text that directly matches the other entity types (such as Compliance_Timeline, Severity_Level, Industry_Sector, Remediation_Action, Legal_Entity, Financial_Institution), it's challenging to extract more entities and relationships without further context or additional text excerpts.\n\nGiven the constraints and the information provided, my previous response should be considered complete based on the text and instructions. If there are specific entities or relationships within the provided text that you believe match the remaining entity types and were not identified, please provide further guidance or additional text for analysis. \n\nFor now, based on the instructions and the text provided, my answer is N.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 201, "prompt_tokens": 3356, "total_tokens": 3557, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
