However, based on the instructions and the data provided earlier, it seems we have already extracted and listed all entities and relationships that fit the specified entity types and their relationships from the given text. If there are specific details or entities within the text that were not addressed and you believe they fit the entity types provided, please clarify or provide additional instructions. Without further specific details from the text that match the entity types (Risk_Category, Regulatory_Requirement, Jurisdiction, Regulatory_Source, Implementation_Method, Compliance_Timeline, Severity_Level, Industry_Sector, Remediation_Action, Legal_Entity, Financial_Institution, Regulatory_Body), it's challenging to add more entities or relationships. \n\nGiven the constraints and the information provided, my previous response should be considered complete. If there's additional text or a different set of entity types you'd like to explore, please provide that for further analysis. \n\nFor now, based on the instructions and the provided text, my final answer is N. \n\nN", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 203, "prompt_tokens": 3781, "total_tokens": 3984, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
