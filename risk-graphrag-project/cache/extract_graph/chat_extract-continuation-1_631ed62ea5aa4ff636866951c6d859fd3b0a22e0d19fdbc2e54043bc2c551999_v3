However, based on the provided text and instructions, all relevant entities and relationships according to the specified entity types have been extracted. The text primarily revolves around regulatory requirements (Art. 94(1)(d) through Art. 94(1)(l)) within the Finnish jurisdiction under the EBA's financial regulation category. Relationships have been established between the jurisdiction, regulatory source, and each regulatory requirement, as well as between the risk category and each regulatory requirement, illustrating the connection within the regulatory framework.\n\nIf there were specific entities or relationships expected beyond these, it might be due to a misunderstanding of the provided text or the entity types specified. The instructions were followed based on the entity types and relationships that could be directly inferred from the text provided.\n\nGiven the constraints and the information provided, there are no additional entities or relationships to extract based on the last set of instructions and the entity types listed.
