However, based on the provided instructions and the text content, it seems that all relevant entities and relationships according to the specified entity types have been extracted. The text primarily discusses the jurisdiction, regulatory source, risk category, and the regulatory body, along with the compliance timeline. Without additional specific text content that includes other entity types such as Regulatory Requirement, Implementation Method, Severity Level, Industry Sector, Remediation Action, Legal Entity, or Financial Institution, it's challenging to extract more entities or relationships that fit the given types.\n\nGiven the constraints and the information provided in the text, there are no further entities or relationships that can be extracted based on the specified entity types. Therefore, my previous response should be considered final.\n\nN", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 150, "prompt_tokens": 3377, "total_tokens": 3527, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
