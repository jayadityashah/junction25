However, based on the instructions and the provided text, it seems I've covered the entities and relationships that were directly identifiable and fit the specified entity types. Given the constraints and the information provided, additional entities or relationships that strictly match the requested types (Risk_Category, Regulatory_Requirement, Jurisdiction, Regulatory_Source, Implementation_Method, Compliance_Timeline, Severity_Level, Industry_Sector, Remediation_Action, Legal_Entity, Financial_Institution, Regulatory_Body) and are clearly defined within the text have been thoroughly identified in the previous responses.\n\nIf there are specific details or aspects of the text that you believe have been overlooked and fit these categories, please provide further guidance or clarification on these points. Without additional context or a more detailed breakdown of the text, it's challenging to identify further entities and relationships that adhere to the given instructions and entity types. \n\nFor completeness and accuracy, I'll reiterate that the extraction process is highly dependent on the explicit mention and clear identification of entities and relationships within the provided text, according to the predefined entity types. \n\nIf you believe there are specific segments of the text that contain additional entities or relationships fitting the described types that have not been extracted, kindly highlight those for a more targeted analysis. \n\nOtherwise, based on the current understanding and analysis of the provided text, the extraction appears comprehensive within the defined scope and instructions. \n\nThank you for your understanding.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 285, "prompt_tokens": 3618, "total_tokens": 3903, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
