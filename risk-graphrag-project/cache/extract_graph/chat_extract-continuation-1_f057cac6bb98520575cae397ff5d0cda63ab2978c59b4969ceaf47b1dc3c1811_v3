However, based on the provided instructions and the text content, it seems that the initial extraction covered the identifiable entities and relationships according to the specified entity types. The text primarily provides information about the jurisdiction, regulatory source, risk category, and a compliance timeline. Without more specific content related to other entity types such as Regulatory Requirement, Implementation Method, Severity Level, Industry Sector, Remediation Action, Legal Entity, Financial Institution, or Regulatory Body in a more detailed context, it's challenging to extract additional entities and relationships that fit the given types.\n\nGiven the constraints and the information provided in the text, no further entities or relationships can be accurately extracted without additional context or assuming details not explicitly mentioned in the text. Therefore, based on the text provided and the instructions, my previous response remains as complete as possible given the available information.\n\nIf there are specific details or examples of entities and relationships that were expected but not identified, please provide further instructions or clarify the types of details that are missing, and I will do my best to address them.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 213, "prompt_tokens": 3275, "total_tokens": 3488, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
