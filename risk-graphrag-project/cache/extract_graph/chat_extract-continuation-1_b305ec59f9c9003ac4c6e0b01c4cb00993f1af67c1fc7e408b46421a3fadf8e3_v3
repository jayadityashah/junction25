However, based on the instructions and the provided text, it seems I've reached the limit of identifiable entities and relationships that can be accurately extracted without further context or additional text content. The text provided primarily revolves around Finnish financial regulations, with specific references to the Vakuutuskassalain (insurance fund law) and responsibilities under it, such as liability calculations and insurance premium responsibilities. \n\nGiven the constraints and the information provided, additional entities and relationships cannot be accurately identified or inferred without repeating previously mentioned entities or without additional context that might reveal new entities or relationships. \n\nIf there's more specific information or another section of the text that needs to be analyzed, please provide that for further analysis. Otherwise, based on the current information, it appears we have identified the relevant entities and their relationships as thoroughly as possible. \n\nN", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 171, "prompt_tokens": 3804, "total_tokens": 3975, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
