However, based on the instructions and the provided text, it seems we have covered the entities and relationships that can be clearly identified and categorized under the specified entity types. Without additional specific text content that includes more entities or relationships fitting the given types, it's challenging to add more without potentially misinterpreting or assuming details not explicitly provided in the text excerpts shared earlier.\n\nGiven the constraints and the information provided in the initial and subsequent responses, it appears we have identified the primary entities and their relationships based on the text related to financial regulation within the Finnish jurisdiction, as provided by the European Banking Authority (EBA).\n\nIf there are specific details or additional text excerpts that have been overlooked or not provided, please share them for further analysis and extraction of entities and relationships.
