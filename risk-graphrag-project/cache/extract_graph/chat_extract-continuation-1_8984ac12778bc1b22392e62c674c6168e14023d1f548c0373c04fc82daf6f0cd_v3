However, without additional specific text or context indicating further entities and relationships that match the given types (Risk_Category, Regulatory_Requirement, Jurisdiction, Regulatory_Source, Implementation_Method, Compliance_Timeline, Severity_Level, Industry_Sector, Remediation_Action, Legal_Entity, Financial_Institution, Regulatory_Body), it's challenging to accurately generate more entities and relationships without repeating or contradicting previous entries.\n\nGiven the information already provided, it seems we've covered the entities and relationships that were clearly identifiable from the provided text excerpts. If there are specific details or aspects of the regulatory framework, compliance requirements, or other elements within the text that have not been addressed, please provide those details for further analysis and extraction.\n\nFor now, based on the instructions and examples provided, and without additional context or text, it appears we have identified the primary entities and relationships from the given text. If there are more specific details or additional text not yet analyzed, please share, and I'll be happy to assist further. \n\nN", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 207, "prompt_tokens": 3966, "total_tokens": 4173, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
