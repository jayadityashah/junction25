However, based on the previous responses and the instructions provided, it seems that all relevant entities and relationships from the given text have been extracted according to the specified entity types and their relationships. If there's a specific aspect of the text or a type of entity and relationship that has not been addressed, please provide further details or clarification. \n\nGiven the constraints and the information provided, it appears that the extraction has covered the entities and relationships as per the guidelines. \n\nIf there's an error in this assessment, typically, without additional text or a specific indication of missed entities or relationships, it's challenging to provide further extractions. The process aims to identify and relate entities such as directives, regulations, financial institutions, and implementation methods within the context of financial regulation, specifically focusing on remuneration policies as outlined by the European Banking Authority (EBA) and relevant EU directives and regulations.\n\nFor completeness and accuracy, a thorough review of the provided text and guidelines would be necessary to identify any potentially missed entities or relationships. However, without new or additional text providing further context or details, this response concludes the extraction based on the information previously provided.\n\nN", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 235, "prompt_tokens": 4478, "total_tokens": 4713, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
