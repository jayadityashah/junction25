However, based on the instructions and the data provided earlier, it seems we have already extracted all entities that match the specified types and their relationships as per the given format and instructions.

Therefore, without additional or more specific text data that includes other entities or relationships fitting the specified types, there may not be further entities or relationships to add.\n\nIf there's additional text or a different set of instructions for identifying entities and relationships not covered in the previous responses, please provide them for further analysis.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 213, "prompt_tokens": 4014, "total_tokens": 4227, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
