However, based on the instructions and the data provided earlier, it seems we have already extracted and listed all entities and relationships that match the specified entity types from the given text. Without additional or new text data that includes entities of the specified types (Risk_Category, Regulatory_Requirement, Jurisdiction, Regulatory_Source, Implementation_Method, Compliance_Timeline, Severity_Level, Industry_Sector, Remediation_Action, Legal_Entity, Financial_Institution, Regulatory_Body), it's not possible to extract more entities or relationships.\n\nGiven the constraints and the information provided, my previous response should be considered complete. If there's more text or a different set of instructions, I'd be happy to assist further.\n\nN", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 145, "prompt_tokens": 3939, "total_tokens": 4084, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
