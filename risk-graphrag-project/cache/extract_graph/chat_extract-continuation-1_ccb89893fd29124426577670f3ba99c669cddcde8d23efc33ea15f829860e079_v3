However, based on the instructions and the provided text, it seems we have covered the primary entities and relationships relevant to the specified entity types.

Otherwise, based on the current information and guidelines, it seems we have captured the relevant entities and relationships. \n\nN", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 167, "prompt_tokens": 3999, "total_tokens": 4166, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
