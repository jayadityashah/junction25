However, based on the instructions and the provided text, it seems that all relevant entities and relationships that match the specified entity types have been extracted. The text primarily discusses financial regulations within the Finnish jurisdiction, mentioning specific laws (vakuutuskassalain), the regulatory body (FIN-FSA Finanssivalvonta), and concepts related to financial regulation risk categories and implementation methods. Without additional specific text content that introduces new entities fitting the given types, it's challenging to add more entities or relationships without repeating or fabricating information not explicitly provided in the text snippets shared earlier.\n\nGiven the constraints and the information provided, it appears we have identified the relevant entities and relationships according to the guidelines and the examples. If there are specific entities or relationships within the provided text that you believe have been missed and fit the specified types, please provide further details or clarification. Otherwise, based on the current understanding and the text provided, there might not be additional entities or relationships to extract that fit the specified types without further context or content. \n\nN", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 214, "prompt_tokens": 3650, "total_tokens": 3864, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
