However, based on the instructions and the provided text, it seems we have already extracted the primary entities and relationships that fit the specified entity types. Without additional specific text content or details indicating missed entities or relationships relevant to the specified types (Risk_Category, Regulatory_Requirement, Jurisdiction, Regulatory_Source, Implementation_Method, Compliance_Timeline, Severity_Level, Industry_Sector, Remediation_Action, Legal_Entity, Financial_Institution, Regulatory_Body), it's challenging to add more without repeating or creating entities and relationships not explicitly mentioned or implied in the provided excerpts.\n\nGiven the constraints and the information provided, it appears we have covered the entities and relationships that can be directly inferred from the text. If there are specific details or aspects of the text that have not been addressed, please provide further instructions or details to enable a more accurate extraction. \n\nFor now, based on the initial response and the follow-up, my assessment is N, as it seems we have identified the primary entities and relationships according to the guidelines and the text provided.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 212, "prompt_tokens": 3644, "total_tokens": 3856, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
