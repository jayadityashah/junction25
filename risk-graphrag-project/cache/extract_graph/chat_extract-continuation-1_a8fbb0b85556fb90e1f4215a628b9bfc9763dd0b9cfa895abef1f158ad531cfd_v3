However, based on the initial instructions and the text provided, it seems that all relevant entities and relationships according to the specified entity types have been extracted. The text primarily mentions regulatory aspects, jurisdiction, and the regulatory source, which have been identified. Without additional specific text content that includes other entity types such as Legal Entity, Financial Institution, Industry Sector, etc., it's challenging to extract more entities or relationships that fit the given categories.\n\nGiven the constraints and the information provided, it appears there might have been a misunderstanding in my previous response regarding the identification of additional entities and relationships. If the text provided earlier contained more specific details related to other entity types (e.g., specific financial institutions, legal entities, industry sectors, implementation methods, severity levels, remediation actions), then it would be possible to identify and extract more entities and relationships. However, based on the segments provided, the extraction seems to align with the instructions.\n\nIf there are specific details or examples missing from the provided text, I would need those details to accurately extract and list additional entities and relationships. Without further specific content, my previous response stands as complete based on the instructions and the text provided.\n\nN", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 241, "prompt_tokens": 3418, "total_tokens": 3659, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
