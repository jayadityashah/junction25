However, based on the provided instructions and the text content, it seems that all relevant entities and relationships according to the specified entity types have been extracted. The text primarily discusses the Finnish jurisdiction, the regulatory source FIVA_MOK, the risk category of financial regulation, the regulatory body FIN-FSA, and the AML Act as a regulatory requirement. The Government Bill 228/2016 was also identified as a regulatory source in the context of financial regulation and its relation to the AML Act.\n\nGiven the constraints and the information provided in the text, there are no additional entities or relationships that fit the specified entity types that have not already been extracted. Therefore, my previous response should be considered complete under the guidelines provided.\n\nIf there were specific entities or relationships expected to be extracted that were not, it might be due to a misunderstanding of the entity types or the content of the text. The instructions were followed as closely as possible based on the entity types and the text provided.\n\nN", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 203, "prompt_tokens": 3488, "total_tokens": 3691, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
