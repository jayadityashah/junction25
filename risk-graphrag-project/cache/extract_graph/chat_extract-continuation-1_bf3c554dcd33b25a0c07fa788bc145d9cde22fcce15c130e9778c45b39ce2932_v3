However, based on the instructions and the data provided earlier, it seems we have covered the entities and relationships that were clearly identifiable and matched the specified entity types. Without additional or specific text content that includes missed entities or relationships relevant to the provided entity types, it's challenging to add more without potentially introducing inaccuracies or assumptions not supported by the text.\n\nGiven the constraints and the information provided in the previous responses, it appears we have identified the primary entities and their relationships as per the guidelines and the text provided. If there are specific details or text content that were overlooked and you believe should be included, please provide those details for further analysis. Otherwise, based on the current understanding and the data provided, it seems we have addressed the task to the extent possible. \n\nN", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 160, "prompt_tokens": 4161, "total_tokens": 4321, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
