However, based on the instructions and the data provided earlier, it seems we have covered the primary entities and relationships that were explicitly mentioned and fit the specified entity types. Without additional specific text content that includes more entities or relationships fitting the given types, it's challenging to add more without repeating or creating speculative entries not directly supported by the text provided.\n\nGiven the constraints and the information provided in the task, it appears we have identified the key entities and their relationships according to the guidelines and the examples. If there are specific parts of the text or additional details that were not included in the initial extraction, please provide them for further analysis. Otherwise, based on the current understanding and the data provided, it might be concluded that the extraction is as complete as it can be given the information at hand.\n\nN", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 165, "prompt_tokens": 3751, "total_tokens": 3916, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
