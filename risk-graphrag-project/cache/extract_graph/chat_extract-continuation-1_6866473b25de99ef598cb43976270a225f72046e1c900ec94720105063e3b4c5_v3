However, based on the instructions and the data provided earlier, it seems we have already extracted a comprehensive list of entities and their relationships relevant to the entity types specified. Without additional specific text or context indicating missed entities or relationships, it's challenging to further extend the list accurately.\n\nGiven the constraints and the information provided, it appears we've covered the entities and relationships as per the guidelines and examples. If there are specific details or text segments believed to be overlooked, please provide them for a more targeted extraction. Otherwise, based on the current understanding and the data provided, it seems we have addressed the task as required. \n\nIf you believe there are still entities or relationships that match the previously extracted types and were missed, kindly provide the specific text or details for further analysis.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 160, "prompt_tokens": 4257, "total_tokens": 4417, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
