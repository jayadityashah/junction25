However, based on the instructions and the provided text, it seems that all relevant entities and relationships according to the specified entity types have been extracted. The text primarily discusses regulatory requirements, compliance timelines, and the entities involved in financial regulation within the Finnish jurisdiction, all of which have been addressed.\n\nIf there are specific details or entities within the text that have not been directly addressed but fall under the specified entity types (Risk_Category, Regulatory_Requirement, Jurisdiction, etc.), it would be beneficial to clarify or specify these so that a more accurate extraction can be provided. Without additional context or specific guidance on missed content, it's challenging to provide further extractions that adhere to the instructions.\n\nGiven the constraints and the information provided, my previous response was intended to capture the core entities and their relationships based on the entity types listed. If there are nuances or additional layers within the text that were not captured, further clarification would be necessary to proceed accurately.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 195, "prompt_tokens": 3823, "total_tokens": 4018, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
