However, based on the instructions and the provided text, it seems that all relevant entities and relationships matching the specified entity types have been extracted and listed in the previous responses. If there are specific details or entities within the text that were overlooked and fall under the defined entity types (Risk_Category, Regulatory_Requirement, Jurisdiction, Regulatory_Source, Implementation_Method, Compliance_Timeline, Severity_Level, Industry_Sector, Remediation_Action, Legal_Entity, Financial_Institution, Regulatory_Body), it appears they were not explicitly mentioned or identifiable in the provided excerpts.\n\nGiven the constraints and the information provided, it's concluded that the previous responses have captured the entities and relationships as per the guidelines. If there are additional texts or details not included in the initial excerpts that contain relevant entities and relationships, those were not available for review.\n\nTherefore, without further specific text or details indicating missed entities and relationships, the response remains as previously submitted.\n\nN", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 192, "prompt_tokens": 4003, "total_tokens": 4195, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
