However, based on the instructions and the data provided earlier, it seems all relevant entities and relationships within the specified entity types have been extracted and listed. If there are specific entities or relationships within the provided text that have not been covered but fall under the listed entity types (Risk_Category, Regulatory_Requirement, Jurisdiction, Regulatory_Source, Implementation_Method, Compliance_Timeline, Severity_Level, Industry_Sector, Remediation_Action, Legal_Entity, Financial_Institution, Regulatory_Body), it appears they were not explicitly mentioned in the text provided for analysis.\n\nGiven the constraints and the information provided, further extraction without additional or specific text data might not yield new entities or relationships. The previous responses have aimed to cover the entities and relationships based on the entity types and text provided.\n\nIf there's additional text or a specific area of focus that was overlooked, please provide that for further analysis. Otherwise, based on the current information, it seems we have identified the relevant entities and relationships according to the guidelines provided.\n\nN", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 207, "prompt_tokens": 4759, "total_tokens": 4966, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
