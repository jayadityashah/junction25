However, based on the initial extraction and the constraints provided, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the request for additional entities and relationships, as the text provided does not contain more specific details that fit the entity types listed beyond what was already extracted. The text primarily focuses on regulatory requirements and the regulatory body without further details on financial institutions, legal entities, or specific compliance timelines that could be extracted as separate entities or relationships.\n\nGiven the constraints and the information provided in the text, there are no additional entities or relationships that can be accurately extracted without speculating beyond the content provided. Therefore, based on the text and the entity types specified, the previous response contains the relevant entities and relationships that could be identified.\n\nIf there are specific entities or relationships within the provided text that you believe have been missed and fit the listed entity types, could you please clarify or provide additional context? This would help in ensuring a more accurate and comprehensive extraction.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 194, "prompt_tokens": 3807, "total_tokens": 4001, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
