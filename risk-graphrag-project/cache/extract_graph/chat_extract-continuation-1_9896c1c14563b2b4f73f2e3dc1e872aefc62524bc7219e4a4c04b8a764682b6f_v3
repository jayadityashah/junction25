However, without additional specific text or context to identify further entities and relationships that match the previously listed types (Risk_Category, Regulatory_Requirement, Jurisdiction, Regulatory_Source, Implementation_Method, Compliance_Timeline, Severity_Level, Industry_Sector, Remediation_Action, Legal_Entity, Financial_Institution, Regulatory_Body), it's challenging to accurately generate more entities and relationships without repeating or contradicting the previous entries.\n\nGiven the constraints and the information provided earlier, it seems we've covered the primary entities and relationships based on the text excerpts provided.
