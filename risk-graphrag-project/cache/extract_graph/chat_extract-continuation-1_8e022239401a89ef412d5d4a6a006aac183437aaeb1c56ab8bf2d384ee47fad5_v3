However, based on the provided text and the instructions, it seems that all relevant entities and relationships according to the specified entity types have been extracted. If there are specific details or entities within the text that were not addressed and fit the entity types (Risk_Category, Regulatory_Requirement, Jurisdiction, Regulatory_Source, Implementation_Method, Compliance_Timeline, Severity_Level, Industry_Sector, Remediation_Action, Legal_Entity, Financial_Institution, Regulatory_Body), it appears they were not explicitly mentioned or identifiable from the provided excerpts.\n\nGiven the constraints and the information provided, it's challenging to identify additional entities and relationships without further context or details from the text. The extraction focused on the most directly mentioned entities related to financial regulation, compliance timelines, and the regulatory body (FIN-FSA) within the Finnish jurisdiction, as well as the acts and directives mentioned.\n\nIf there are specific sections of the text that mention other entities fitting the listed types, I would need those excerpts highlighted to provide further extractions. Without additional details or corrections to the initial oversight, I must conclude based on the information given.\n\nN", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 226, "prompt_tokens": 3986, "total_tokens": 4212, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
