However, based on the provided instructions and the text content, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the initial response. The text primarily contains references to regulatory aspects within a specific jurisdiction (Finnish), provided by a regulatory source (FIVA_MOK), and mentions various compliance timelines. Without specific names, descriptions, or clear relationships beyond those initially identified, it's challenging to extract additional entities and relationships without further context or details from the text. \n\nGiven the constraints and the information provided in the text, it appears we've captured the primary entities and their relationships based on the available data. If there were specific entities or relationships within the text that were not captured due to the lack of explicit mention or clear connection to the listed entity types, they cannot be added without further context or assuming details not provided in the text. \n\nTherefore, based on the instructions and the text provided, there are no additional entities or relationships that can be accurately extracted and formatted according to the given requirements without further information. \n\n<|COMPLETE|>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 213, "prompt_tokens": 3428, "total_tokens": 3641, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
