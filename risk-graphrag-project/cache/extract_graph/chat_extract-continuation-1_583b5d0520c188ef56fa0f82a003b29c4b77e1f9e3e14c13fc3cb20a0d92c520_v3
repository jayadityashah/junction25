However, based on the provided instructions and the text content, it seems we have covered the identifiable entities and relationships that match the specified entity types. The text primarily provides information about financial regulations within the Finnish jurisdiction, mentions the regulatory body FIN-FSA Finanssivalvonta, and references compliance timelines. Without additional specific content or context that matches the predefined entity types (such as specific Legal Entities, Financial Institutions, or detailed Regulatory Requirements beyond the general category of financial regulation), it's challenging to extract more entities or relationships from the given text excerpts.\n\nIf there were more detailed paragraphs or specific mentions of laws, financial products, companies, or direct regulatory actions, it would be possible to identify and extract additional entities and relationships. Given the constraints and the information provided, the response appears to align with the requirements.\n\nIf there's additional text or a different focus required, please provide more details or clarify the types of entities and relationships expected to be extracted from the provided text.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 200, "prompt_tokens": 3551, "total_tokens": 3751, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
