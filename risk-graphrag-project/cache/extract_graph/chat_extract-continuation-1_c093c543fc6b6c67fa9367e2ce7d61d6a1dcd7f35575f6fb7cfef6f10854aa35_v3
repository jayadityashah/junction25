However, based on the instructions and the provided text, it seems that all relevant entities and relationships according to the specified entity types have been extracted. The text primarily revolves around regulatory requirements, a regulatory body, and compliance timelines within the Finnish jurisdiction, all of which have been identified. \n\nIf there are specific details or nuances within the text that have not been directly addressed or if there are additional entity types or relationships that have not been considered but are believed to be present, please provide further guidance or clarification. Without additional context or a more detailed understanding of missing elements, it's challenging to identify further entities or relationships beyond those already extracted. \n\nGiven the constraints and the information provided, my assessment is that the extraction is complete. However, this assessment is based on the information provided and the instructions for identifying entities and relationships. \n\nN", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 172, "prompt_tokens": 4150, "total_tokens": 4322, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
