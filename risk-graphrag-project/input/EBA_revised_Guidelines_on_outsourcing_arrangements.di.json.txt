[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_102012: Trust in the reliability of the financial system is crucial for its proper functioning and is a prerequisite if it is to contribute to the economy as a whole. Effective internal governance arrangements are fundamental if institutions individually and the financial system they form as a whole are to operate well.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_102013: Over recent years, financial institutions have been increasingly interested in outsourcing business activities also in order to reduce costs and improve their flexibility and efficiency. In the context of digitalisation and the increasing importance of new financial technology (fintech) providers, financial institutions are adapting their business models to embrace such technologies. Some have intensified the use of fintech solutions and have launched projects to improve their cost efficiency also in response to the intermediation margins of the traditional banking business model being put under pressure by the low interest rate environment. Outsourcing is a way to get relatively easy access to new technologies and to achieve economies of scale.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_102014: Directive 2013/36/EU (Capital Requirements Directive; CRD) strengthens the governance requirements for institutions and Article 74(3) CRD gives the EBA the mandate to develop guidelines on institutions' governance arrangements. Outsourcing is one of the specific aspects of institutions' governance arrangements. Directive 2014/65/EU (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive; MiFID II) contains explicit provisions regarding the outsourcing of functions in the field of investment services and activities. Directive 2015/2366/EU (Revised Payment Service Directive; PSD2) sets out requirements for the outsourcing of functions by payment institutions.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_102015: The EBA is updating the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) guidelines on outsourcing that were issued in 2006, which applied exclusively to credit institutions; the aim is to establish a more harmonised framework for all financial institutions that are within the scope of the EBA's mandate, namely credit institutions and investment firms subject to the CRD, as well as payment and electronic money institutions. The guidelines set out specific provisions for these financial institutions' governance frameworks with regard to their outsourcing arrangements and the related supervisory expectations and processes. The recommendation on outsourcing to cloud service providers, published in December 2017, has been integrated into the guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_102016: Each financial institution's management body remains responsible for that institution and all of its activities, at all times; to this end, the management body should ensure that sufficient resources are available to appropriately support and ensure the performance of those responsibilities, including overseeing all risks and managing the outsourcing arrangements. Outsourcing must not lead to a situation in which an institution becomes an 'empty shell' that lacks the substance to remain authorised.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_102023: The guidelines set out which arrangements with third parties are to be considered as outsourcing and provide criteria for the identification of critical or important functions that have a strong impact on the financial institution's risk profile or on its internal control framework. If such critical or important functions are outsourced, stricter requirements apply to these outsourcing arrangements than to other outsourcing arrangements.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_102024: Competent authorities are required to effectively supervise financial institutions' outsourcing arrangements, including identifying and monitoring risk concentrations at individual service providers and assessing whether or not such concentrations could pose a risk to the stability of the financial system. To identify such risk concentrations, competent authorities should be able to rely on comprehensive documentation on outsourcing arrangements compiled by financial institutions.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_102031: 1. Trust in the reliability of the financial system is crucial for its proper functioning and is a prerequisite if it is to contribute to the economy as a whole. Effective internal governance arrangements are fundamental if credit institutions and investment firms subject to Directive 2013/36/EU1 (CRD) (both referred to as 'institutions'), payment institutions and electronic money institutions (both referred to as 'payment institutions') and the financial system they form part of are to operate well.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_102032: 2. Over recent years, there has been an increasing tendency by institutions and payment institutions to outsource activities also in order to reduce costs and improve flexibility and efficiency. In the context of digitalisation and the increasing importance of information technology (IT) and financial technologies (fintech), institutions and payment institutions are adapting their business models, processes and systems to embrace such technologies. IT has become one of the most commonly outsourced activities. Notwithstanding its benefits, outsourcing IT and data services poses security issues and challenges to the governance framework of institutions and payment institutions, in particular to internal controls as well as to data management and data protection.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_102033: 3. Some institutions and payment institutions have intensified the use of IT and fintech solutions and have launched projects to improve their cost efficiency also in response to the intermediation margins of the traditional banking lending model being put under pressure by the low interest rate environment. Outsourcing is a way to get relatively easy access to new technologies and to achieve economies of scale, e.g. by centralising functions within a group or institutional protection scheme.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_102034: 4. The importance of outsourcing functions to cloud service providers has increased rapidly in many industries. In 2017, the EBA addressed the specificities of outsourcing to the cloud by developing recommendations on outsourcing to cloud service providers,2 which were based on the 2006 CEBS outsourcing guidelines. The recommendations aimed at overcoming the high level of uncertainty regarding supervisory expectations on outsourcing to cloud service providers and at removing the barriers that this uncertainty caused for institutions proceeding with using cloud services. The recommendations have been integrated in the present guidelines and will be repealed when the guidelines enter into force.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_102035: 5. Outsourcing of important or critical functions, in particular when the service provider is located outside the EU, creates specific risks both for institutions and payment institutions and for their competent authorities and should be subject to appropriate oversight.

Outsourcing arrangements should not create undue operational risks or impair the quality and independence of institutions' and payment institutions' internal controls or the ability of those institutions and payment institutions and the competent authorities to oversee and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements.

PARAGRAPH_102043: 7. Outsourcing is also relevant in the context of gaining or maintaining access to the EU's financial market. Third-country institutions and payment institutions may wish to set up subsidiaries or branches in the EU to get or maintain access to the EU's financial markets and infrastructures. In this context, third-country institutions and payment institutions may seek to minimise the transfer of the effective performance of business activities to their subsidiaries and branches located in the EU, e.g. by relying on the outsourcing of functions to the third-country parent institution or other third-country group entities.

PARAGRAPH_102044: 8. Outsourcing must not lead to a situation where an institution or a payment institution becomes an 'empty shell' that lacks the substance to remain authorised.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]

PARAGRAPH_102046: 10.Competent authorities must grant authorisation in full compliance with Union law; should set a strict framework, in line with these guidelines, on outsourcing by institutions and payment institutions in the EU to third-country entities; and should ensure consistent and effective supervision. Competent authorities should also ensure that institutions and payment institutions have policies and procedures in place to comply with the relevant framework at all times.

PARAGRAPH_102047: 11.Institutions and payment institutions should be able to effectively control and challenge the quality and performance of outsourced functions and be able to carry out their own risk assessment and ongoing monitoring.

PARAGRAPH_102056: 15. The EBA is updating the CEBS guidelines on outsourcing issued in 2006, which applied exclusively to credit institutions, with the aim of establishing a more harmonised framework for the outsourcing arrangements of financial institutions. The scope of application of these guidelines covers not only credit institutions and investment firms subject to the CRD (referred to as 'institutions'), but also payment and electronic money institutions (referred to as 'payment institutions'). The guidelines are not directly addressed to credit intermediaries and non-bank creditors that are subject to Directive 2014/17/EU6 or to account information service providers that are only registered for the provision of service 8 of Annex I to the PSD2. Outsourcing arrangements between institutions, payment institutions and such entities are within the scope of the guidelines when such entities act as outsourcing service providers.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_102057: 16. The update of the guidelines takes into account and is consistent with the current requirements under the CRD, Directive 2014/65/EU7 (MiFID II), Directive 2009/110/EC& (Electronic Money Directive; EMD), the PSD2 and Directive 2014/59/EU9 (Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive;

PARAGRAPH_102069: 17.Under Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/201010 (the EBA Regulation), the EBA is required to issue guidelines and recommendations addressed to competent authorities and financial institutions with a view to establishing consistent, efficient and effective supervisory practices and ensuring the common, uniform and consistent application of Union law. In particular, the conditions for outsourcing of functions of banking activities by institutions are not harmonised to the same extent as for institutions and payment institutions subject to MiFID II and PSD2.

PARAGRAPH_102070: 18. Divergent regulatory approaches carry a risk of regulatory arbitrage, which may expose the EU to financial stability risks. Those risks are particularly acute in relation to the outsourcing of functions by institutions and payment institutions to third countries, where supervisory authorities may lack the necessary powers and tools to adequately and effectively supervise service providers that provide critical or important functions to EU institutions and payment institutions.

PARAGRAPH_102072: 20. The use of the term 'critical or important functions' is based on the wording of MiFID II and the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 supplementing MiFID II. It is used only for the purpose of identifying 'critical or important functions' under outsourcing arrangements to which a specific set of requirements apply. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 specifies, under Article 30, that 'an operational function shall be regarded as critical or important where a defect or failure in its performance would materially impair the continuing compliance of an investment firm with the conditions and obligations of its authorisation or its other obligations under Directive 2014/65/EU, or its financial performance, or the soundness or the continuity of its investment services and activities'. The same approach exists under Directive 2009/138/EC12 (Solvency II), while, in the context of outsourcing, the PSD2 uses 'important function' for the purpose of identifying functions under outsourcing arrangements for which specific requirements apply. Therefore, to embrace all existing legislation and to ensure a level playing field for credit institutions, investment firms, payment institutions and electronic money institutions, the wording used under MiFID II is used within the guidelines. It should be noted

PARAGRAPH_102098: 24. While the guidelines focus on the outsourcing of critical or important functions, institutions and payment institutions need to consider that receiving services, including IT services, from third parties creates risks, even when those arrangements are not considered to be outsourcing arrangements or when the outsourcing arrangements would concern functions that are not critical or important. To manage all risks, institutions and payment institutions should assess the risks that result or may result from those arrangements, in particular the operational and reputational risk.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:11] [RISK:CONCENTRATION_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_102099: 25. The risks to be considered include those associated with the institution's or the payment institution's relationship with the service provider, the risk caused by allowing for sub- outsourcing, the concentration risk posed by multiple outsourcings to the same service provider and/or the concentration risk posed by outsourcing critical or important functions to a limited number of service providers. The concentration of outsourcing at a limited number of service providers is particularly relevant for competent authorities when supervising the impact of outsourcing on the stability of the financial market. In addition, overreliance on outsourcing of critical or important functions is likely to impact the conditions for authorisation and to heighten both concentration risks and the risk of creating 'empty shells' that would lack the substance to remain authorised.

PARAGRAPH_102106: 28.Where institutions and payment institutions intend to outsource important or critical functions to entities within the same group, they should ensure that the selection of a group entity is based on objective reasons and that the conditions of the outsourcing arrangement are set at arm's length and explicitly deal with conflicts of interest that such an outsourcing arrangement may entail. Institutions and payment institutions should clearly identify all relevant risks and detail the mitigation measures and controls put in place to ensure that the outsourcing arrangements with affiliated entities do not impair the institution's or payment institution's ability to comply with the relevant regulatory framework. However, when outsourcing within the same group, institutions and payment institutions may have a higher level of control over the outsourced function, which they could take into account in their risk assessment.

PARAGRAPH_102110: 32.Outsourcing does not lower institutions' and payment institutions' obligation to comply with regulatory requirements and internal corporate values, e.g. those set out within a code of conduct.

However, audit and access rights for competent authorities need to be ensured for all outsourcing arrangements to ensure that institutions can be effectively supervised. Further guidance is provided on how institutions and payment institutions can exercise their audit rights in a risk-based manner, taking into account concerns regarding the organisational burden for both the outsourcing institution or payment institution and the service provider, as well as practical, security and confidentiality concerns regarding physical access to certain types of business premises and access to data in multi- tenant environments.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:14] [RISK:OPERATIONAL_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_102128: 40.The performance and quality of the cloud service provider's service delivery and the level of operational risk that it may cause to the outsourcing institution or payment institution are largely determined by the ability of the cloud service provider to appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data (in transit or at rest) and of the systems and processes that are used to process, transfer or store those data. Appropriate traceability mechanisms aimed at keeping records of technical and business operations are also key to detecting malicious attempts to breach the security of data and systems. Security expectations should take into account the need, on a risk-based approach, to protect the data and systems.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:14]
PARAGRAPH_102129: 41.Cloud service providers often operate a geographically dispersed computing infrastructure that entails the regional and/or global distribution of data storage and processing; therefore, the security and privacy of data and their processing requires particular attention.

PARAGRAPH_102131: 43. The guidelines specify that sub-outsourcing requires ex ante notification to institutions and payment institutions in the case of outsourcing of critical or important functions.

In addition, institutions and payment institutions should inform competent authorities or engage with competent authorities in a dialogue regarding planned outsourcing arrangements, in particular with regard to critical or important functions.

PARAGRAPH_102139: 46. The need to monitor and manage concentration risk is particularly relevant for certain forms of IT outsourcing, including cloud outsourcing, which is dominated by a small number of highly dominant service providers. For instance, compared with more traditional forms of outsourcing offering tailor-made solutions to clients, cloud outsourcing services are much more standardised, which allows the services to be provided to a larger number of different clients in a much more automated manner and on a larger scale. Although cloud services can offer a number of advantages, such as economies of scale, flexibility, operational efficiencies and cost- effectiveness, they also raise challenges in terms of data protection and location, security issues and concentration risk, not only from the point of view of individual institutions but also at industry level, as large suppliers of IT and cloud services can become a single point of failure when many institutions rely on them. Likewise, the development and increased use of financial technology providers requires specific attention.

PARAGRAPH_102416: 46. Where outsourcing creates material conflicts of interest, including between entities within the same group or institutional protection scheme, institutions and payment institutions need to take appropriate measures to manage those conflicts of interest.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:35]
PARAGRAPH_102417: 47. When functions are provided by a service provider that is part of a group or a member of an institutional protection scheme or that is owned by the institution, payment institution, group or institutions that are members of an institutional protection scheme, the conditions, including financial conditions, for the outsourced service should be set at arm's length. However, within the pricing of services synergies resulting from providing the same or similar services to several institutions within a group or an institutional protection scheme may be factored in, as long as the service provider remains viable on a stand-alone basis; within a group this should be irrespective of the failure of any other group entity.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:35]
PARAGRAPH_102420: 49. Business continuity plans should take into account the possible event that the quality of the provision of the outsourced critical or important function deteriorates to an unacceptable level or fails. Such plans should also take into account the potential impact of the insolvency or other failures of service providers and, where relevant, political risks in the service provider's jurisdiction.

PARAGRAPH_102719: 115. Competent authorities should ensure that EU/EEA institutions and payment institutions are not operating as an 'empty shell', including situations where institutions use back-to-back transactions or intragroup transactions to transfer part of the market risk and credit risk to a non-EU/EEA entity, and should ensure that they have appropriate governance and risk management arrangements in place to identify and manage their risks.

PARAGRAPH_102735: 118. Where concerns are identified that lead to the conclusion that an institution or payment institution no longer has robust governance arrangements in place or does not comply with regulatory requirements, competent authorities should take appropriate actions, which may include limiting or restricting the scope of the outsourced functions or requiring exit from one or more outsourcing arrangements. In particular, taking into account the need of the institution or payment institution to operate on a continuous basis, the cancellation of contracts could be required if the supervision and enforcement of regulatory requirements cannot be ensured by other measures.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:56] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_102744: The CEBS guidelines on outsourcing, published in 2006, were applicable exclusively to credit institutions and needed to be replaced by EBA guidelines applicable to all institutions and payment institutions to establish a more harmonised framework for the outsourcing arrangements of all financial institutions in the scope of the EBA's action. The update was also necessary to take into account changes within EU legislation. In addition, outsourcing to third countries may change in volume after the UK's notification of its intention to leave the EU. Furthermore, the scope and nature of outsourcing arrangements have changed over time and, in particular, the outsourcing of IT processes and infrastructures became more common. High concentrations of IT services at a limited number of service providers have the potential to lead to risks for the stability of the financial market, particularly if no additional safeguards would be implemented.

PARAGRAPH_102746: To ensure a level playing field and to meet the requirements of the CRD, PSD2 and EMD, the EBA is now updating the guidelines issued by its predecessor to establish one common framework for the outsourcing of all financial institutions within the scope of the EBA's action.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:56]
PARAGRAPH_102747: To cater for the principle of proportionality and in accordance with the approach taken in the MiFID II and PSD2, the guidelines require that the outsourcing of critical or important functions be identified and impose stricter requirements on such outsourcing compared with other outsourcing arrangements.

PARAGRAPH_102748: The guidelines aim to clarify the supervisory expectations regarding outsourcing to service providers, including service providers located in third countries, to ensure that outsourcing is performed in an orderly manner and not performed to an extent that would lead to the setting up of empty shells that no longer have the substance to remain authorised.

PARAGRAPH_102753: C. Baseline scenario

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:57]
PARAGRAPH_102754: Outsourcing requirements are currently specified in the CEBS guidelines on outsourcing. In addition, the EBA has published a recommendation on outsourcing to cloud service providers. Outsourcing by firms performing investment services is regulated under MiFID II and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565. Outsourcing by payment institutions is regulated under the PSD2.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:57] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_102755: Institutions should comply with the CRD. Article 74 CRD requires institutions to have robust governance arrangements, which include a clear organisational structure with well-defined, transparent and consistent lines of responsibility, effective processes to identify, manage, monitor and report the risks they are or they might be exposed to and adequate internal control mechanisms. The EBA Guidelines on internal governance sufficiently specify the requirements, including the need for institutions to have appropriate outsourcing policies (see Section 8 of the guidelines); in addition, outsourcing needs to be approved as part of the institution's new product approval and change processes (see Section 18 of the guidelines).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:57]
PARAGRAPH_102756: Article 76 CRD sets out requirements for the involvement of the management body in risk management and Article 88 CRD sets out the responsibilities of the management body regarding governance arrangements; in both cases, the requirements are relevant for outsourced activities.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:57] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_102757: According to Article 11 PSD2, competent authorities should grant an authorisation only if, taking into account the need to ensure the sound and prudent management of a payment institution, the payment institution has robust governance arrangements for its payment services business, which include a clear organisational structure with well-defined, transparent and consistent lines of responsibility, effective procedures to identify, manage, monitor and report the risks to which it is or might be exposed, and adequate internal control mechanisms, including sound administrative and accounting procedures; those arrangements, procedures and mechanisms must be comprehensive and proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the payment services provided by the payment institution.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:58]
PARAGRAPH_102766: Option B: applying the guidelines to all credit institutions and investment firms (both referred to as 'institutions') that are subject to the CRD, payment institutions that are subject to the PSD2 and electronic money institutions subject to the EMD (both referred to as 'payment institutions').

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:58]
PARAGRAPH_102767: Firms providing investment services are subject to the specific provisions on outsourcing included in MiFID II and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 of 25 April 2016 supplementing MiFID II.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:58] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_102768: MiFID II and PSD2 already set out a framework for outsourcing. An application limited to credit institutions and their banking activities would be sufficient to complete the framework on outsourcing. However, such an approach (Option A) would potentially lead to inconsistencies between the different frameworks and to a situation in which there is not a level playing field between investment firms, payment institutions, electronic money institutions and credit institutions. In particular, credit institutions would need to implement separate arrangements for the different types of activities.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:58] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_102769: The EBA's scope of action covers not only credit institutions and investment firms subject to the CRD, but also payment and electronic money institutions. While the guidelines would cover all those institutions and payment institutions, the guidelines would not directly be addressed to account information service providers registered only for this service, credit intermediaries or non- bank creditors. Outsourcing arrangements between institutions and payment institutions and such entities are within the scope of the guidelines, as the requirements are addressed to institutions and payment institutions. Such an approach (Option B), if the requirements are aligned with the provisions within MiFID II and the supplemental Commission Delegated Regulation and within the PSD2, would establish a level playing field between different types of financial institutions and ensure that credit institutions can implement one framework for the outsourcing of their activities governed by different directives. The specific aspects of intragroup outsourcing and outsourcing within institutional protection schemes will be considered.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:58]

PARAGRAPH_102773: Option B: setting the regular implementation period of six months and setting out transitional arrangements to ensure that institutions can review contracts, update the assessment of the criticality or importance of outsourcing and set up a register and update the documentation in line with the requirements.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:58]
PARAGRAPH_102774: Option B1: setting a fixed transitional period of around two years to review contracts, perform assessments and complete the register.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:58]
PARAGRAPH_102775: Option B2: setting a period of around two years (other than for outsourcing arrangements to cloud service providers, for which the EBA recommendation already applies), but requiring documentation and assessments to be updated if existing outsourcing arrangements are renewed during that period. For critical or important arrangements, closer supervisory attention should be applied and, after the transitional period, their reassessment should be monitored.

PARAGRAPH_102779: All options would be effective to achieve the desired prudential outcome to have all outsourcing arrangements documented in a way that differentiates between critical and important outsourcing, sets out a framework for such outsourcing and allows for the submission of a register to competent authorities.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:59] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_102780: Option A would delay the implementation of a common framework on outsourcing. Option A would lead to time pressure to re-assess the criticality or importance of outsourcing arrangements and update the register and this option might therefore increase the implementation costs. In addition, it might not be possible to renegotiate multiple outsourcing arrangements in a relatively short time period. Therefore, Option A has not been retained.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:59] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_102781: Options B1 and B2 would both ensure that institutions and payment institutions have sufficient time to update their assessments and documentation. However, Option B1 would raise challenges, as contracts would need to be renegotiated within that time period, which may not always be possible.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:59]
PARAGRAPH_102782: Option B2 would lead to a faster update than Option B1 for arrangements that are renewed during the transitional period, but without additional burden, as an assessment of renewed outsourcing arrangements would include the assessment of the related risks. Updating the documentation in that context would be possible without causing material additional costs. Option B2 would have some impact on the available time frame for the development of a database that could hold the register. However, for this task, the regular implementation period should be sufficient. Additional scrutiny would be applied to critical or important outsourcing arrangements that are updated only after the transitional period. While this would lead to additional costs for competent authorities for the monitoring of the transition, it would reduce the costs of institutions, as the time pressure for renegotiation of contracts or, in some cases, exit from arrangements (where there is no renegotiation possible that ensures compliance with the guidelines) would be reduced.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:59]

PARAGRAPH_102788: Using a common definition (Option A) ensures that institutions can implement a single framework for outsourcing regarding all of their activities and develop a good understanding of the scope of outsourcing.

PARAGRAPH_102791: EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:60]
PARAGRAPH_102792: importance includes judgemental elements and therefore institutions, payment institutions and competent authorities may sometimes disagree regarding the assessment result. Retroactively introducing safeguards for the outsourcing of critical or important functions, also in cases where the assessment changes over time, could lead to additional costs and situations where necessary contractual changes are difficult to agree on. In addition, the overall impact of outsourcing arrangements that are themselves not critical or important might become relevant for the supervision of an institution.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:60] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_102793: Under Option B, the impact described under Option A would apply; in addition, some requirements for all outsourcing would be imposed, taking into account the principle of proportionality. This would lead to only a minor additional administrative burden, as institutions would already need to have in place some processes to manage all of their arrangements with third parties. In any case, also for other outsourcing arrangements, institutions would already need to apply sound processes and would need to document the arrangements to ensure that they have robust governance arrangements in place. Having guidelines in place that specify the regulatory minimum expectations for such non-critical or non-important arrangements would provide a higher level of legal certainty. Costs for adjustments of internal processes should be minor. It would be ensured that the outsourcing process would be subject to a prescribed set of controls, which should mitigate the additional measures that would need to be taken if an outsourcing arrangement became critical or important over time, e.g. because of the scalability of the arrangement.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:60]
PARAGRAPH_102794: A narrower definition of outsourcing (Option C) for banking activities would limit the number of outsourcing arrangements and this would, at first sight, reduce the administrative costs of applying the guidelines. However, the framework should ensure a sufficient focus on the outsourcing of critical or important functions and, by doing so, this would limit the administrative burden. A different definition would require different frameworks for different activities (e.g. banking versus investment services) and would lead to challenges in their application, as some arrangements affect banking, but also investment and payment services (e.g. underlying IT infrastructures). Therefore, Option C is not effective.

PARAGRAPH_102819: Option B1 would lead to slightly lower costs, as not all outsourcing arrangements would need to be included in the register. However, documentation would be necessary in any case. By including at least a limited set of information (Option B2) for all other outsourcing arrangements, the identification of concentration risks would be even better than in Option B1. As a register would already exist, the costs would be low, as the costs would be limited to those involved in the input of a few additional data points into the register. Option B2 would be more efficient than Option B1.

PARAGRAPH_102820: Adding planned outsourcing to the register (Option C) would give competent authorities the possibility to evaluate the potential effect of upcoming outsourcing arrangements combined with other existing outsourcing arrangements. However, it would also lead to a situation where institutions and payment institutions would enter potential arrangements that would not come into effect, leading to minor additional costs for adding such arrangements to the register. However, if arrangements were entered into the register only if they were nearly certain, they would be entered relatively quickly and therefore this process might not ensure that competent authorities were informed in a timely manner about upcoming outsourcing arrangements.

PARAGRAPH_102821: Option D would ensure that competent authorities would be informed about upcoming outsourcing arrangements and would have the opportunity to intervene if they had concerns about potential risks or if such an arrangement would lead to a situation where the institution would become an empty shall that lacked the substance for ongoing authorisation. The impact on costs for institutions and payment institutions would be low, but if feedback from the competent authority (Option E) was expected, this might delay the implementation of arrangements and could therefore lead to additional costs. In most jurisdictions, such processes (Option D) already exist and therefore the costs would be limited to jurisdictions where no prior discussion had taken place. A dialogue between institutions and competent authorities regarding outsourcing improves the effective supervision of firms.

PARAGRAPH_102835: 7) Outsourcing of banking activities and payment services that require authorisation by a competent authority

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:63]
PARAGRAPH_102836: Although most outsourcing arrangements involve activities or services (or parts thereof) that do not, in themselves, require authorisation by a competent authority, institutions may occasionally want to outsource functions or parts of banking or payment services or activities, to an extent that would require authorisation or registration in their Member State, to service providers located in third countries. The outsourcing of investment services is regulated under Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 of 25 April 2016.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:63]
PARAGRAPH_102837: The outsourced parts of banking activities or payment services may themselves require authorisation. However, the full service or activity, i.e. including the responsibility for the service or activity, can never be outsourced. While, within the EU, a common framework for authorisation and supervision applies, outsourcing to third countries would, in most cases, not be subject to the same framework. Therefore, this specific type of outsourcing arrangement should be allowed only if:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:63]
PARAGRAPH_102838: . the service provider in the third country is authorised by or registered at a relevant supervisory authority to perform the activity or service; and

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:63]
PARAGRAPH_102839: . the outsourcing arrangement will not undermine the ability of the competent authority in the Member State to effectively supervise the outsourcing institution or payment institution. This will commonly require that the competent authority is able to receive the information needed for its supervisory tasks and exercise access and audit rights in the third country and that there exist mechanisms for the exchange of information on enforcement matters.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_102844: Option A would allow the outsourcing of banking and payment activities or services, which are subject to authorisation or registration, to third countries only if there is an appropriate cooperation agreement between the competent authority of the institution and the supervisory authority of the service provider.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_102845: Option B would be an outcomes-focused approach and would require institutions and payment institutions to be satisfied that any proposed outsourcing of functions (or parts of banking or payment services or activities) that require direct authorisation to service providers located in third countries would not prevent or undermine the ability of competent authorities in their Member State to effectively supervise them. Competent authorities would have the power to take measures if effective supervision were not possible.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_102846: Option A would be in line with the approach for investment services under Article 32 of the Commissions Delegated Regulation, which requires such a cooperation agreement in the case of outsourcing functions of portfolio management; it ensures that the rights and responsibilities of the competent authority and the supervisory authority would be set out in writing.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_102847: However, such an approach would also require competent authorities to enter into multiple, lengthy negotiations with third countries to conclude the required cooperation agreements, even if institutions and payment institutions would need to be satisfied that there is a cooperation agreement between the competent authority of the institution or payment institution and the competent authority in the third country responsible for supervising such services or activities where they outsource those banking and payment activities or services. If a cooperation agreement does not exist, then outsourcing of banking and payment activities or services into the third country is not possible.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_102848: Option B recognises that effective supervision could be achieved through a variety of arrangements and mechanisms, including, but not necessarily limited to, cooperation agreements or supervisory colleges. Although more flexible and pragmatic, Option B would require competent authorities to determine that they can effectively discharge their supervisory duties in practice. In particular, competent authorities need to be satisfied that they will not be faced with restrictions regarding the exercise of information, access and audit rights. This is clearly more difficult without signing a cooperation agreement. Competent authorities would also need to reserve the right to require institutions and payment institutions to not enter into or terminate existing outsourcing agreements if the outsourcing concerned an activity or service that was itself subject to authorisation, if the competent authorities were not satisfied that they would be able to effectively supervise it. This approach would lead to legal uncertainty about the possibility of outsourcing functions to service providers in third countries.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:65]
PARAGRAPH_102857: Option A would be in line with the principle of contractual freedom and the principle that the institution or payment institution is responsible for its outsourcing arrangements. Requirements specified in MiFID II and PSD2 would have to be met. However, such a guideline would not provide sufficient clarity regarding audit and access rights and other aspects that facilitate the appropriate management of outsourcing arrangements (e.g. termination and exit rights).

PARAGRAPH_102858: Option B would help institutions and payment institutions to agree on contracts that meet the minimum requirements expected by competent authorities, in particular with regard to the outsourcing of critical or important functions. The approach to audit, one aspect that is particularly difficult to negotiate, would be described in detail, leading to a higher level of efficiency at institutions and payment institutions when negotiating contracts. Such requirements are already included in the recommendation on outsourcing to cloud service providers and information and access rights are outlined in Article 65 CRD. The implementation of these requirements for other new outsourcing arrangements should not lead to additional material costs, in particular if the scope of such a requirement is restricted to a subset of outsourcing arrangements; instead it would ensure that outsourced activities can be monitored, audited and supervised.

PARAGRAPH_102862: Option A: the guidelines should provide a detailed procedural framework for supervision by competent authorities, including the timing of procedures and the need to assess new critical and important outsourcing arrangements before they are implemented.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:65] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]

PARAGRAPH_102864: An assessment of outsourcing arrangements by competent authorities before their implementation (Option A) might lead to additional costs at institutions and payment institutions, as the implementation of processes could be delayed.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:66]
PARAGRAPH_102872: A higher level of clarity on outsourcing requirements benefits institutions by creating a higher level of transparency regarding regulatory requirements and supervisory expectations.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:66]
PARAGRAPH_102873: Harmonisation should increase the efficiency of supervision. In particular, the identification and supervision of concentration risks by competent authorities may have a positive effect on the stability of the financial markets. However, this means that competent authorities will have to assign more resources to the supervision of such risk concentrations and/or may have one-off IT costs for establishing databases and inputting data to better track such concentrations. Those costs should be limited, as, on a risk-based approach, such measures should be limited to critical or important outsourcing.

PARAGRAPH_102875: However, the guidelines will trigger some implementation costs for institutions (credit institutions and investment firms) and payment institutions, which will differ depending on their nature:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:66] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_102876: a. For payment institutions and investment firms subject to the CRD, considering that the sectoral directives already establish a set of requirements for outsourcing that is quite detailed, the additional costs should be very low.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:66]
PARAGRAPH_102877: b. For credit institutions subject to the CRD, a detailed framework exists regarding their investment and payment services and activities. Regarding banking activities, the previous CEBS guidelines form the basis of the EBA guidelines and therefore the additional costs triggered by the guidelines should be low overall.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:66] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_102878: For institutions and payment institutions, the guidelines may require an update of the current internal documentation, as well as the implementation and maintenance of a formal register in the form of a database. Some minor one-off costs may be triggered by the need to update outsourcing policies and to establish the register of all outsourcing arrangements (e.g. in terms of the additional data input on top of existing internal documentation). The overall impact is considered low, as institutions and payment institutions must already have documentation in place regarding their organisational structure, which includes outsourcing arrangements. Moreover, a formal register with minimum requirements will also be beneficial to the management of outsourcing arrangements and will improve the identification of risk concentrations on a micro and macro level.

PARAGRAPH_102882: The assessment of the criticality or importance of outsourcing arrangements by institutions subject to the CRD is also a requirement to consider. The criteria are consistent with other legislation in place; therefore, the additional costs are considered to be low. In addition, the guidelines provide clarity and harmonised criteria that need to be implemented by all institutions and payment institutions (i.e. not only by institutions subject to the CRD). The clear difference in the requirements for outsourcing critical or important functions and for other outsourcing arrangements benefit institutions and payment institutions in terms of the allocation of internal resources. The guidelines provide clear criteria to identify a function as critical or important, including where a defect or failure materially impairs the activities and financial performance. This is more evident for core business lines and critical functions already defined by the other legislation in place. Most institutions and payment institutions should have such processes in place regarding their investment and payment services and activities and, therefore, the roll out to banking activities should not be complex. The additional clarity, the protection of the level playing field and the proportionality of requirements all benefit the institutions and payment institutions. Therefore, the additional costs should be very low and should mainly be one-off costs for implementing the procedures needed. Given the existing procedures and the consistency with the other legislation that is already in place, the cost for applying new, more harmonised, procedures in the area of banking activities should be low. The risk assessment of outsourcing arrangements needs to include a more thorough assessment of the operational risks. The assessment of whether a function or part thereof is outsourced on a recurrent basis is a task already conducted on an ongoing basis. The identification of concentration risks caused by the outsourcing of multiple functions to one service provider may create additional, although low, costs, but only if this is not already part of the regular assessment of operational risk and concentration risk.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:67]
PARAGRAPH_102883: The guidelines provide clarification on the treatment of the outsourcing of functions by institutions and payment institutions when considered at the group level and when taking into account the possible interlinkages between operational risks. All institutions and payment institutions should already be familiar with risk assessments; all should already conduct scenario analyses at the individual and group levels and perform such risk assessments in line with other legislation and other EU guidelines, as they are obliged to manage all of their risks. Therefore, there are low additional costs for institutions and payment institutions.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:67] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_102884: Clear contractual requirements, including requirements to assure access and audit rights, lead to minor one-off costs and reduce the ongoing costs for negotiating outsourcing arrangements with service providers, as they establish a non-debateable set of contractual conditions to be agreed on. The clarification of supervisory expectations regarding outsourcing arrangements benefits institutions and payment institutions during the negotiations of contractual conditions and practical deliveries and creates a level playing field.

PARAGRAPH_102890: 1. The EBA conducted a consultation on the draft guidelines on outsourcing over a three- month period, ending on 24 September 2018; a public hearing was held on 4 September 2018. During the consultation period, the EBA, together with the chair of the EBA's Subgroup on Remuneration and Governance, had meetings with some significant European Associations (the European Banking Federation, the European Association of Co-operative Banks and the European Savings and Retail Banking Group) to discuss their concerns.

PARAGRAPH_102894: 3. Respondents commented that the guidelines' scope of application and the definition of outsourcing were too wide. First, respondents required confirmation that the guidelines do not apply to subsidiaries that are themselves not subject to CRD on a solo basis, but only on a consolidated basis. In particular, the situation of alternative investment funds (AIFs), undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) and third-country subsidiaries should be clarified. Regarding the definition, many respondents provided examples of arrangements that should not be considered as outsourcing and requested the inclusion of a (non-exhaustive) list of arrangements that should not be considered as outsourcing in the guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:68]
PARAGRAPH_102895: 4. Respondents also considered that the draft guidelines were too far-reaching, as they extend to arrangements that are not critical or important. They found it too burdensome that the risk assessment and due diligence provisions were in fact applicable to all third-party arrangements. Respondents suggested that the focus be only on the outsourcing of critical and important functions.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:70]
PARAGRAPH_102913: 11. The EBA has taken into account and provided detailed feedback on the comments received during the public consultation. The following table provides a summary of the responses to the consultation and of the EBA's analysis.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:70]
PARAGRAPH_102914: 12. Overall, the guidelines have been reviewed to provide better differentiation between the requirements for the outsourcing of critical and important functions, to which a stricter framework applies, and for other, non-material, outsourcing.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:70]
PARAGRAPH_102915: 13. The guidelines have been restructured to better mirror the MiFID II approach that (1) defines outsourcing, (2) defines critical and important functions and (3) sets out the requirements for institutions when outsourcing such functions. Considering the general governance requirements for institutions, the requirements for outsourcing of non-critical or non-important functions have been retained in a proportionate manner.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:70]
PARAGRAPH_102916: 14. The guidelines have been checked for consistency with the EBA recommendation on outsourcing to cloud service providers and the PSD2 requirements on outsourcing.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:70]
PARAGRAPH_102917: 15. It should be noted that, in general, all of the content of the recommendation on outsourcing to cloud service providers has been retained; however, changes to the approach have been made to ensure consistency with the overall outsourcing framework, which differentiates between the requirements for critical and important outsourcing and those for other, non-material, outsourcing arrangements.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:70]
PARAGRAPH_102918: 16. The application of the requirements in the context of a group and an institutional protection scheme have been clarified. While the context of groups and institutional protection schemes needs to be taken into account, all institutions remain responsible for compliance with regulatory requirements.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:71]
PARAGRAPH_102930: Some respondents took the view that EBA alone does not have the mandate to set up rules that applied on a (sub-) consolidated basis, given that its mandate and expertise is restricted to banking business models. It has been proposed that cooperation be established between all European Supervisory Authorities to ensure a proportional approach to different businesses.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:71]
PARAGRAPH_102931: Article 74 CRD requires that the EBA develop guidelines on governance; this includes developing guidelines on outsourcing. The guidelines take into account other relevant European legislation. There is close cooperation between all three European Supervisory Authorities. The guidelines are in line with Article 109 CRD, which requires that governance requirements be applied on a sub-consolidated and a consolidated basis.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:71]
PARAGRAPH_102933: One respondent commented that extending the CRD rules to subsidiaries that are subject to sector-specific rules, for which the EBA has no competence, is an infringement of the EBA's legal mandate.

PARAGRAPH_102959: Many respondents highlighted that the guidelines should maintain sufficient flexibility for EU institutions to react and adapt to market innovations and should not introduce burdensome requirements or restrictions, which could potentially reduce competition and/or increase the costs associated with the supply of services to institutions. Respondents suggested that the guidelines should differentiate between regulatory requirements (which are mandatory) and guidance (which allows flexible and proportionate application). Overall, it was suggested that the level of detail of the guidelines be reduced.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:72]
PARAGRAPH_102960: The principle of proportionality applies to the CRD, CRR and PSD and to all of the EBA guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:73]
PARAGRAPH_102984: Competent authorities and the EBA have no direct role in the oversight of service providers that do not fall within the scope of their action. There is no legal basis for introducing a certification for 'approved service providers'.

PARAGRAPH_102989: Cooperation agreements between supervisory authorities

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:73]
PARAGRAPH_102990: Respondents found the requirement that cooperation agreements (Memorandums of Understanding; MoUs) be signed in third countries too burdensome and a few suggested that other existing supervisory arrangements be considered that may facilitate cross-border supervision, including supervisory colleges and the idea that cooperation agreements may be informal.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:73] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_102991: Cooperation agreements with authorities in third countries must be reliable and effective if functions are outsourced to an extent that would require authorisation or registration. Institutions need to be aware of such cooperation arrangements; therefore, only formal arrangements can be relied on.

PARAGRAPH_103029: General comments on the scope and definitions

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:75]
PARAGRAPH_103030: Some respondents supported the idea of aligning the definition of outsourcing with the one in MiFID II; others suggested different, narrower, definitions. Several respondents pointed out that the scope of the guidelines was wider than that of MiFID II, as the strict limitation to critical and important functions and the explicit exclusion of certain functions (e.g. advisory service, (personnel) training, billing, premises services and the purchase of standardised services) in MiFID II were missing from the guidelines. In addition, respondents noted that the EBA guidelines broadened the application by including 'parts thereof' in addition to the process, service or activity, as well as by addressing all outsourcing arrangements (i.e. also non-critical or non- important arrangements). Some respondents requested that, for the sake of clarity, these guidelines be limited in a proportionate and risk-based manner to 'critical or important' outsourcing arrangements. Several respondents commented that the legal basis for including non- critical and non-important outsourcing arrangements was not clear. The MiFID II framework limits the requirements to critical or important functions; establishing additional requirements for all outsourcing arrangements can be achieved at the legislative level only. The EBA therefore would, through these guidelines, go beyond its powers by creating new law.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:75]
PARAGRAPH_103031: The definition of outsourcing has been fully aligned with the definition in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 supplementing MiFID II. It would not be practical for institutions to apply different definitions for different activities (i.e. banking activities versus investment and payment services). It is the EBA's view that the definition applies also to parts of functions that are outsourced. Such parts of functions are themselves processes, services or activities that fall into the scope of the definition. The additional explanations have been moved into a different section to avoid any confusion with the definition of outsourcing. However, other non-material outsourcing arrangements should also be managed by institutions as part of their governance arrangements. Article 74 CRD includes a specific mandate for the EBA to develop guidelines on governance, including the operational structure of institutions. Outsourcing arrangements are part of institutions' operational structure. Similar governance requirements exist in the PSD2 and MiFID II. In addition, the EBA is mandated within Article 16 of its Founding Regulation (EU) 1093/2010 to provide guidelines within its scope of action. The EBA has reviewed the guidelines and introduced, taking into account the principle of proportionality, further simplifications for other (i.e. non-material) outsourcing arrangements.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:77]

Two respondents suggested that these guidelines apply to payment and electronic money institutions only when they outsource an operational function, in particular providing that their service through an agent (distributor) is already sufficiently regulated.

PARAGRAPH_103144: Some respondents requested further clarification regarding the definition of sub-outsourcing and suggested that sub- outsourcing be clarified as concerning only the service that was delegated and not the governance arrangements of the service provider or the infrastructures used by it. Some respondents suggested that any requirements regarding sub-service providers be deleted and that the institutions' responsibility be limited to their direct counterparties or at least that the requirements be limited to critical or important outsourcing arrangements. Other respondents requested that the definition be limited to services relevant for the outsourced function.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:80] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_103145: The definition has been clarified. A situations is also considered sub-outsourcing where parts of the outsourced function are provided by a sub-service provider. The assessment follows the same pattern as the assessment of institutions' arrangements with third parties. Sub-outsourcing can change the risk and reliability of outsourcing arrangements. Therefore, the institutions must have a say and be aware of such arrangements, in particular regarding critical or important outsourcing arrangements, while the initial service provider also has monitoring obligations. The institution remains fully responsible for the function and compliance with regulatory requirements in the case of outsourcing and sub-outsourcing.

PARAGRAPH_103161: Respondents, while pointing out that cloud outsourcing and the types of it are defined terms, urged the EBA to take a more technologically neutral approach so that the guidelines would be capable of including new or emerging IT services. A few respondents suggested that a lighter framework be created for outsourcing to 'multi-tenant service providers'. One respondent highlighted the need to take into account that many cloud products are characterised by being highly standardised services, which are offered to a broad range of customers and undertaken by monopolists (e.g. Microsoft, Oracle and SAP). Therefore, respondents argued that it should be acknowledged, as in the BaFin's MaRisk, that multi-tenant service providers of standardised IT services cannot comply with all regulatory requirements and a proportionate approach should be allowed (in particular regarding access and audit rights and the required minimum content of contractual arrangements). Respondents also noted that the guidelines' requirements relating to cloud services are generally ICT specific and therefore should not be included in an outsourcing contract solely on the basis that some components are in a cloud environment.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:81] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_103162: The guidelines do not restrict or promote the outsourcing of certain IT structures or technologies. It was decided that the EBA recommendations on outsourcing to cloud service providers would be integrated into the general outsourcing framework. Institutions should comply with all regulatory requirements, including with regard to their outsourced functions, independent of the fact that they may be standardised or provided by monopolists. The named service providers are currently themselves not directly subject to the regulatory requirements set out in the CRD. The guidelines - in the same way as the cloud recommendation - already include simplifications, e.g. with regard to the performance of audits, that also apply to the outsourcing of functions to multi-tenant service providers. However, audit rights are a basis for effective oversight and supervision and so need to be ensured contractually for at least critical and important functions and on a risk-based approach, in particular as it is assumed that institutions will progressively use cloud and other IT solutions. The definition of cloud services does not state that all cloud services are also outsourcing arrangements. However, all risks of arrangements with third parties have to be managed.

PARAGRAPH_103179: The principle of proportionality needs to be applied based on sound judgement and considering the list of non-exhaustive criteria referred to in the guidelines.

PARAGRAPH_103183: Respondents welcomed the presence of the proportionality principle but asked the EBA to provide more clarity on the reference to the principle of proportionality, as they deemed the reference to the EBA internal governance guidelines to be insufficient, as the proportionality criteria included in these guidelines did not consider the complexity or scope of outsourcing arrangements. Some respondents suggested that outsourcing requirements should not be applied, based on proportionality considerations, to intragroup outsourcing or outsourcing to monopolists.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:82]
PARAGRAPH_103184: In line with the CRD (e.g. recital 54 and Article 74), proportionality in the area of governance applies with regard to the nature, scale and complexity of the institution. The criteria set out in the EBA guidelines include the fact that the group structure should be taken into account. The guidelines on outsourcing further specify how the guidelines should be applied. Proportionality does not mean that requirements are not applied; instead it means that requirements are applied in a proportionate way. However, a differentiation between the requirements for critical or important functions and other functions has been made, where appropriate.

PARAGRAPH_103200: Respondents pointed out that the current wording of the guidelines implies that the guidelines have an extraterritorial application; respondents suggested that there should be a restriction of the scope to the authorised entities located in the EU. Other respondents suggested that the scope of application be limited to subsidiaries that are themselves subject to the CRD. A few respondents asked for further guidance on how this principle should be applied to the different risk models of AIF managers and UCITS managers. Respondents highlighted the importance of taking into consideration group recovery and resolution frameworks and the implementation of a proper exchange of information between EU competent authorities and resolution authorities to establish proportionality (in particular regarding Section 9.2, concentration risk in paragraph 59 and Section 12).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:83] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_103201: See comments on Question 1, paragraph 9. In accordance with Article 109 CRD, the guidelines cannot deviate from those provisions. The guidelines apply to subsidiaries, including subsidiaries located in third countries that are not directly subject to the guidelines, but are covered by its requirements on a consolidated basis, i.e. considering that the parent and its subsidiary would form one single entity. The responsibility to implement the guidelines and to ensure compliance with the guidelines lies, in that situation, with the consolidating institution. The guidelines follow the approach set out within Articles 21 and 109 CRD. Therefore, they are applicable on a group level only, if the waivers have been granted. The CRD does not set out waivers in the area of internal governance or outsourcing for institutions that are affiliated to a central body. The guidelines set out how the provisions should be applied in this specific situation where a waiver has been granted under the CRD. The existence of recovery and resolution plans cannot lead to a waiver of requirements in a business-as-usual scenario. However, some elements of such plans, e.g. exit plans, may in some cases be sufficient for the purpose of the outsourcing guidelines.

PARAGRAPH_103215: Several respondents commented that the proposed requirements on documentation, due diligence, concentration risk and exit strategy would be less relevant or even irrelevant from an intragroup or IPS perspective. The guidelines should recognise that the management of intragroup outsourcing should be proportionate to the risks presented by these arrangements. There should also be lower compliance and reporting obligations in these cases than for third-party outsourcing agreements. Various respondents stressed the importance of acknowledging that institutions that are part of certain financial structures (i.e. groups, IPSs and networks) do have to transfer tasks due to legal, regulatory or operational reasons or circumstances; such arrangements should not be considered as outsourcing. This would be particularly true in the case of small cooperative banks, which are either affiliated to a central body/institution in accordance with Article 10 or 113(7) CRR or embedded in a network. In particular, respondents noted that the services of clearing houses (within the framework of payment transactions and securities settlement), risk models, liquidity management and internal auditing performed by the parent undertaking or central institution should not be considered as outsourcing. Some suggested that the guidelines should better take into account the benefits of intragroup outsourcing, the degree of integration reached within many banking groups and the complementary measures and controls already required by other financial regulations such as the BRRD. For example,

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:84]
PARAGRAPH_103216: The guidelines are in line with the CRD provisions. They cannot introduce waivers that go beyond the Level-1 or -2 requirements. Institutions have to have robust governance arrangements in place on an individual basis. The management body of an institution always retains the final responsibility for the institution, including for the appropriate management of all risks. Intragroup outsourcing and IPS outsourcing can indeed be cost effective and efficient ways of receiving or sharing services. Intragroup/IPS outsourcing is not free from risks.

In addition, intragroup/IPS arrangements must be documented; this is obvious with regard to recovery and resolution planning requirements and is needed to ensure that institutions can be sure that such arrangements enable them to provide the services continuously to their customers. Potential conflicts of interests must be identified and managed; it cannot be per se assumed that intragroup outsourcing is free from such conflicts. Business continuity plans must cover the whole group of institutions or institutions within an IPS and must also be implemented and tested (e.g. by being involved in the central testing of arrangements) by single institutions within the group or IPS.

PARAGRAPH_103231: Respondents urged the EBA to align the requirements with the provisions of the BRRD and highlighted that intragroup arrangements should not be subject to replacement tests for third-party outsourcing, but should be dealt with within the context of shared service agreements, global recovery and resolution plans. The guidelines should not ignore the requirements for resolution plans laid down in Section A of the Annex to the BRRD and the final regulatory technical standards on the content of these plans (e.g. Article 7 of the regulatory technical standards) and should recognise the approved plans. Respondents noted that competent authorities should coordinate with the relevant resolution authorities when applying these guidelines to avoid duplication of work and urged the EBA to implement cooperation and information sharing between competent authorities.

PARAGRAPH_103232: The guidelines have been clarified. Where such plans include sufficient exit strategies from outsourcing arrangements, it is not necessary to define additional strategies for this purpose. However, it needs to be clarified that the BRRD requirements are tailored for a specific purpose that deviates from a business-as- usual scenario. Institutions should also consider in their operational risk and business continuity management that a failure of an internal service provider may have a material impact on their business activities.

PARAGRAPH_103273: Some respondents proposed that, for institutions organised in a financial network (within or outside an IPS), a similar centrally organised regime as for groups, where waivers have be granted, should be recognised. An IPS is required to prove that there is no current or foreseen material, practical or legal impediment to the immediate transfer of own funds or the repayment of liabilities from the counterparty to the institution. Furthermore, the IPS has to demonstrate that it has suitable and uniform stipulated systems in place to monitor and classify risks and the corresponding possibilities to take influence, providing a complete overview of the risk situations of all the individual members and the IPS as a whole.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:88]
PARAGRAPH_103289: Some respondents stressed that the scope of outsourcing arrangements is further expanded due to the provision stipulating that, for the determination of outsourcing, it does not matter whether the specific institution is or will be able to perform the function itself or not. In some structures, the central institution or specialised entity is set up with the purpose of performing standardised services for the affiliated institutions that would not be able to undertake those services by themselves (due to small banks' lack of ability to bear the costs or to reach the level of quality safeguarded by those specialised entities). By considering it irrelevant whether an institution has performed that function in the past or would be able to perform it by itself, the number of contracts falling within the scope would increase significantly. Some respondents highlighted the need to include an element of time (duration or continuing) in the definition of 'outsourcing'.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:88]
PARAGRAPH_103290: When a function is normally performed by institutions in general and is provided by a service provider, the arrangement should usually be qualified as outsourcing, even if the individual institution has not performed it itself or would also not be able to perform it.

Furthermore, confirmation was requested of the fact that such agreements would not be considered as critical or important (e.g. the failure of a DDoS protection system causing the payment institution's website to break down). Some respondents considered that services that are performed by all entities and are usually obtained from third parties or are not related to a licensed core banking activity or risk management are not 'normally performed by an institution' (e.g. bookkeeping, tax advice and tax compliance services, statutory reporting/accounting, custody audits, human resources, payroll accounting, purchasing computers, infrastructure, tenant-like electricity or other connections). Supporting tasks such as administrative or technical functions, e.g. logistical support in the form of cleaning, catering and procurement of basic services or products, should also not be deemed as outsourcing.

PARAGRAPH_103331: Where functions do not require licensing, they can be provided by any suitable service provider. However, it must be ensured that the conditions of the institutions' authorisation are respected. This also holds true in the case of sub-outsourcing. Institutions have to include appropriate checks within their due diligence process to determine if the service provider has an authorisation or is registered.

PARAGRAPH_103373: Some respondents suggested that the policy should focus more on the outsourcing of functions that are critical and important. Some respondents found the conflict of interest requirements (in particular in group situations) to be not sufficiently clear (e.g. 'material conflict'). A few respondents suggested that the economic aspect (e.g. cost-effectiveness, reduction of risks) be taken into account by including provisions regarding a cost-benefit analysis. One respondent requested a clarification on whether the term 'policy' refers to a physical document or to frameworks and standards (i.e. a broader definition).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:92]
PARAGRAPH_103374: Conflicts of interest (see also the EBA Guidelines on internal governance) need to be identified and managed. They can occur at different levels, e.g. group entities, business lines or economic interests of members of the management body or staff. Institutions should also take into account their business needs and the costs and benefits of outsourcing arrangements. However, the present guidelines focus on the prudential aspects of outsourcing arrangements. The term 'policy' is based on substance rather than form; it does not matter if there is one document or if overall appropriate policies are in place.

PARAGRAPH_103400: Some respondents considered that establishing a new function or key function holder would involve significant effort and be a burden (in terms of cost and time) and suggested that, instead, this responsibility should be left to the institution. Some suggested deleting this requirement completely. Respondents requested that the principle of proportionality be applied and that a member of the management body (especially in smaller or non-credit institutions, e.g. payment institutions) be allowed to be the responsible person. Furthermore, respondents highlighted that outsourcing rules should be in line with institutions' three line of defence approach.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:93]
PARAGRAPH_103401: The guidelines require that at least one person should be responsible for managing outsourcing arrangements or for establishing a function. This will depend on the size of the institution and the number and materiality of outsourcing arrangements. It is not a requirement that this person does not have other functions, as long as those functions do not conflict with the person's role as 'outsourcing officer'. It is indeed possible to assign the responsibility to a member of the management body.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:94]
PARAGRAPH_103423: Respondents pointed out that paragraph 32(g), in combination with paragraphs 89-91, requires that an alternative service provider or the ability to reintegrate a critical or important function is needed to ensure comprehensive, documented and sufficiently tested exit plans; however, it is not always possible to meet these provisions. In addition, for critical or important functions, an exit strategy should not be required. Respondents highlighted that, in general, the guidelines should provide more clarity on what an 'appropriate time frame' would be. One respondent requested clarification on whether the reference to 'going concern' relates to situations where a supplier fails.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:94] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_103424: While the requirements of exit strategies have been revised, institutions must be able to ensure the continuity of the business activities or at least be able to end activities if a service provider cannot be replaced, the service cannot be provided internally or the continuity of the function cannot be ensured otherwise. The EBA refrained from providing an exact time frame, as this will depend on the impact of a potential disruption and the complexity of the outsourcing arrangement. 'Going concern' was added to differentiate the situation from a resolution scenario, but has been deleted as this may still be relevant under resolution scenarios, where the continuity of services is desired.

PARAGRAPH_103431: A few respondents suggested that the guidelines should be restricted to consolidated entities to which the statutory outsourcing provisions are applicable.

PARAGRAPH_103432: The guidelines follow the approach under Article 109 CRD. Institutions need to ensure that policies are implemented on a consolidated basis (prudential scope of consolidation). This consequently means that group policies should also apply to subsidiaries that individually are not subject to the CRD, including institutions located in third countries.

PARAGRAPH_103478: Some respondents considered that Section 5 should be clarified with respect to intragroup/affiliate outsourcing arrangements and how competent authorities should supervise it. A few respondents considered that the section on the internal audit function should be applied by the institutions on a risk- based approach. Some respondents highlighted that service providers, in particular multi-tenant service providers, often refuse access to their internal control files and findings, regulatory reports or intrusion tests due to confidentiality reasons. One respondent stressed that the PSD2 framework did not require any specific conflict of interest requirements.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:96] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_103479: The guidelines have been clarified regarding the group/IPS context. The internal audit function, in line with the guidelines and the guidelines on internal governance, should be applied on a risk- based approach. Institutions must comply with all regulatory requirements, including with regard to their outsourced functions, independent of whether or not the service provider is operating in a multi-tenant environment. Audit rights are a basis for effective oversight and supervision and need to be ensured contractually, in particular for the outsourcing of critical or important functions.

PARAGRAPH_103488: A few respondents pointed out that the guidelines would need to take into account the fact that institutions can also act as service providers. Therefore, the different natures of the counterparties needed to be taken into account and the EBA should allow a different approach.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:97]
PARAGRAPH_103489: The PSD2 requires payment institutions to have robust governance arrangements. Institutions remain fully responsible in the case of outsourcing and it does not really matter if the service provider is an institution or not: the same requirements apply. This aspect can be taken into account in the due diligence process.

PARAGRAPH_103490: Paragraph 37

PARAGRAPH_103495: Some respondents asked for clarification of what is considered a 'material conflict of interest' and a 'sufficient level of objectivity' for the purpose of this paragraph. Some respondents stressed that, in the case of group/IPS/cooperative structures, the principle of 'arm's length' cannot apply, as the strategic decisions take into account all parties interests causing no negative influences for anyone.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:97] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_103496: See comments on paragraph 37. It is the responsibility of institutions to assess their materiality and decide on and implement, as appropriate, mitigating measures. Imposing arm's length conditions is one measure to avoid conflicts of interest, also considering possible recovery and resolution scenarios. However, synergies within groups or an IPS context may be considered.

PARAGRAPH_103510: A few respondents sought clarification of the term 'severe business disruption'. One respondent asked for criteria to be given to assess 'disaster recovery' and asked for clarification on how this differs from a business continuity plan. Some respondents suggested that backup testing should be required only when it is appropriate, as some providers do not have backup facilities and instead store data on active servers. Therefore, it should be availability that is ensured, not the testing of backup facilities. A few respondents asked for clarification on the use of the term 'periodically' and suggested that periodical testing not be required, as the costs are very high.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:98]
PARAGRAPH_103514: Some respondents asked if it is necessary for institutions to already have a contract with another service provider on hold for all critical or important outsourced functions or if such a contract should be on hold only for the functions bearing extraordinarily high risks, or alternatively if a risk-based assessment with documented contingency plans would be sufficient. Some respondents asked for clarification regarding the application of a business continuity plan on chains of outsourcing and asked about a risk-based approach.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:98]
PARAGRAPH_103515: Business continuity plans should take into account the possibility that the quality of the provision of the outsourced critical or important function will deteriorate to an unacceptable level or fails. Such plans should also take into account the potential impact of the insolvency, or other failures, of service providers and, where relevant, political risks in the service provider's jurisdiction. The guidelines do not require institutions to already have contractual arrangements with alternative providers.

PARAGRAPH_103518: Some respondents considered that the review of outsourced activities (including on-site visits) performed under audit rights should not be limited to the internal audit function but should be set on an instructional level, allowing specialised (second or third line of defence) functions (e.g. IT, legal, compliance, etc.),

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:98]

PARAGRAPH_103528: outsourced specialists (e.g. third-party certifications, external auditors, etc.) or a combination of the above to undertake them on a risk-based approach. The third line of defence should, on a risk-based approach, visit critical or important service providers, ensuring in particular that the guidelines' provisions are met; this is currently the responsibility of a mix of all three lines of defence. Some respondents stressed that there should be a reference to pooled audits and third-party certificates in this section (with a reference to paragraphs 74 and 75) and that many service providers do have an internal audit function; therefore, it should be clarified that their assessment and outcomes may be used (in particular if the service provider is an institution). One respondent was of the view that payment and electronic money institutions should not be required to have an internal audit function.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:99]
PARAGRAPH_103529: The guidelines focus on the third line, as it is the one usually in charge of audit. This is independent of ongoing monitoring activities that are also required. The guidelines specify that the internal audit function should perform its tasks taking into account a risk-based approach. Even if service providers do have an internal audit function, institutions cannot exclusively rely on it on an ongoing basis, at least for critical or important functions. Institutions are the ones subject to the regulatory requirements (see the section on audit rights). Payment and electronic money institutions should have sound governance arrangements, taking into account the application of proportionality.

PARAGRAPH_103530: Paragraph 43

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:99]
PARAGRAPH_103531: Many respondents considered that full audit rights are necessary only in the case of critical or important outsourcing, as negotiating those rights in all contracts (especially with third- country suppliers) would be burdensome. Many respondents sought clarification on how audit rights may effectively be enforced if the contractual rights are denied by predominant providers. Therefore, it was suggested that standardised reports (e.g. ISAE 34.02) be accepted for meeting the requirements of paragraphs 43 and 74.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:99]
PARAGRAPH_103532: The guidelines have been amended to accommodate the comments. Audit rights are needed for at least critical or important functions, otherwise institutions would no longer have robust governance arrangements in place. See new Section 13.3 on audit and access rights. The guidelines have been revised to allow for a more principle- based and proportionate approach. Institutions should also refer to the EBA's internal governance guidelines.

PARAGRAPH_103548: Some respondents asked whether or not the register could be sourced from various data components or if it has to be a stand- alone data repository. One respondent stressed that Annex X is far too detailed. Some respondents suggested that a centralised register for cooperative networks without an IPS should be allowed and that the guidelines should clearly mention that the maintenance of the register could be outsourced.

PARAGRAPH_103549: It does not matter whether the register is sourced from various data components or if it is a stand-alone data repository, as longs as the information can be provided timely to the competent authority on request. However, to make it more effective and to ease the process, one single repository or the submission of one file to the competent authority would be more practical. Annex X has been deleted. The possibility of having a centralised register within groups or cooperative networks/IPSs has been included in the guidelines. See comments on groups/IPSs. Confidentiality should be ensured by institutions. Competent authorities are subject to professional secrecy obligations.

A few respondents asked for guarantees to be included in the guidelines about any commercially confidential information that may be contained within the register, as very sensitive matters are covered. It was suggested that the register should be internal and access to it should be limited. Some respondents pointed out that it would be impossible to provide all of the information on a sub-outsourcing provider and that proportionality should be applied.

PARAGRAPH_103560: Most of the respondents asked for the register to be limited to critical or important outsourcing arrangements. In particular, respondents argued that the burden is very high for including unimportant peripheral and substitutable services, compared with their low-risk impact.

PARAGRAPH_103582: cloud outsourcing should be considered as critical or important if it is assessed as such in accordance with Section 9.1. Some respondents were of the view that the term 'at least' should be deleted to allow for proportionality. Some respondents pointed out that some information (e.g. costs) should not be mandatory, as they are available only on an aggregated basis.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:102]
PARAGRAPH_103583: The use of the term 'at least' allows there to be a minimum list of information that institutions should include in the register. This allows for a level playing field among institutions when they are establishing the register and fosters sufficiently supervisory convergence, while allowing institutions to add additional information for their own purposes.

PARAGRAPH_103651: Some respondents suggested that the wording 'directly linked' be changed to 'directly connected' to reduce the scope. One respondent suggested that additional criteria for payment and electronic money institutions not be included, as Article 19(2) PSD2 already provides sufficient criteria.

PARAGRAPH_103652: The comment has been accommodated. Institutions, when assessing whether or not an outsourcing arrangement is critical or important, i.e. whether it concerns a critical or important function, should take into account the criteria, meaning that the application of the principle of proportionality is also considered.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:106]
PARAGRAPH_103675: Many respondents asked for clarification on whether or not the due diligence process applies to all outsourcing arrangements or only to the critical or important arrangements.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:106]
PARAGRAPH_103676: Some respondents highlighted that there is not always a need for a due diligence process, or at least not on an individual basis for all institutions. It was suggested that the competent authorities perform this task by supervising the service providers or issuing quality labels or certifications. Another suggestion was that the EBA issue certification schemes in line with the Commission Working Group on cloud security certification schemes. Some respondents pointed out that the due diligence process, or at least some criteria of it, would not be necessary for intragroup outsourcing, as it would be redundant when adequate governance was set up and would sometimes be dependent on the outsourcing arrangement itself, such as the service provider's business model, nature, scale, complexity and financial situation. Particularly in the case of an IPS or a cooperative network, it would simply be a formal process, as the centralised entities are set up for the main purpose of providing the specific services and therefore the ability, capacity, resources and organisational structure are tailored to the needs and features of the members. Therefore, in such cases, institutions should be exempted from the due diligence requirement.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:106]
PARAGRAPH_103677: Institutions and payment institutions should ensure in their selection and assessment process that the service provider is suitable. Therefore, for all outsourcing arrangements to service providers, a due diligence process is required. This process can in some cases, e.g. within a group or IPS, be quite simple and should be performed in any case on a risk-based approach, i.e. taking into account the criticality of the function. The due diligence section focuses on the outsourcing of functions that are critical or important. Institutions are and remain fully responsible for the outsourced function and for performing the due diligence process. It is not to the responsibility of competent authorities to perform the due diligence process, as they are not responsible for the supervision of service providers. At the group/IPS level, the due diligence process should be performed; however, it can be done centrally. See group/IPS section.

PARAGRAPH_103700: Some respondents commented that the risk assessment section could better differentiate between requirements for critical or important outsourcing arrangements and for non-critical arrangements. A few respondents felt that the risk assessment requirements were too demanding and not tailored to intragroup outsourcing arrangements. A few respondents highlighted that it could be difficult for institutions to perform the risk assessment of sub-outsourcing activities and suggested entities analyse their provider's sub- outsourcing policies to guarantee adequate control of their risks and service level agreements, instead of actually verifying full compliance by each sub-outsourced provider.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:107] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_103701: Institutions should assess the risk before entering into an outsourcing arrangement and, in particular, should assess the criticality of the function. A risk assessment is needed for all outsourcing arrangements, even if in some cases it might be trivial. At the group/IPS level, the risk assessment can be done centrally, but institutions remain responsible for the decision to enter into the outsourcing arrangement. See section on groups/IPSs. Sub-outsourcing, in particular of critical or important functions (or part of them), should be in the scope of the risk assessment.

PARAGRAPH_103711: Several respondents considered that the requirement to perform and document scenario-based risk assessments is too prescriptive and not proportionate, as it applies to each outsourcing arrangement. They consider that adequate risk management is also possible without using scenarios of risk events, in particular for non-critical outsourcing arrangements. One respondent considered that payment and electronic money institutions should not apply this requirement for the sake of proportionality and because the PSD2 and the EBA Guidelines on IT security do not require the general application of a scenario- based approach to risk management.

PARAGRAPH_103712: The comments have been taken into account and the supervisory expectations have been clarified. The risk assessment, in particular for payment institutions and small and non-complex institutions, can be qualitative.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:109]
PARAGRAPH_103734: Several respondents considered it difficult for institutions, in practice, to have access to the relevant information to conduct risk assessments of multiple sub-outsourcers. Institutions should be responsible only for the relationship with their direct provider, and service providers should be responsible for, or at least participate in, the risk assessments in the case of sub- outsourcing.

PARAGRAPH_103735: If part of a critical or important function has been outsourced to a sub-service provider, this means that the institution gave its consent and therefore has assessed that the relevant information could be provided and that sub-outsourcing does not unduly increase its operational risk.

PARAGRAPH_103739: Institutions should take measures to protect data in the light of their sensitivity (i.e. if they are of a personal or confidential nature).

PARAGRAPH_103763: Many respondents asked that the guidelines be shorter, less specific and more principle-based regarding the contractual requirements. The whole section should apply only to the outsourcing of critical and important functions. One respondent considered that frequent use of terms such as 'should include at the least', in areas that are relevant to contracts, could encourage laundry lists and gold plating approaches and may lead to unnecessary friction and uncertainty during contract negotiations/repapering.

PARAGRAPH_103791: Several respondents viewed this requirement as burdensome and costly, as locations can change, especially for cloud-based service providers. One respondent considered that the requirement in paragraph 63(e) that the outsourcing agreement must include the 'location' where data will be kept presents serious security concerns in the context of cloud services, including exposing the infrastructure and data centre personnel to increased risk of attacks.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:111]

PARAGRAPH_103819: Several respondents suggested that a more proportionate approach on sub-outsourcing be taken, as this would not necessarily create more risks. In addition, respondents considered that requiring a high level of control over sub- contractors would raise practical issues, in particular regarding payment and cloud services. It is indeed extremely difficult for an institution to control a cloud service provider's outsourcing chain due to its dynamic nature. Several respondents asked for confirmation on whether the whole sub-section applies only to the outsourcing of critical and important functions. A few respondents suggested that the service provider should be held liable for any activity performed by third parties and that financial institutions should be kept informed of any sub- outsourcing by the service provider and should be able to swiftly

PARAGRAPH_103820: The section on sub-outsourcing applies to critical and important functions that have been outsourced by institutions. If such functions or material parts of them are sub-outsourced, the additional requirements apply. However, institutions may impose similar requirements also for other outsourcing arrangements, e.g. if they assume that the sub-outsourcing would increase their risks materially. In any case, institutions remain fully responsible for complying with all regulatory requirements when outsourcing functions. The liability of the service provider is part of the contractual arrangements that should be agreed between the service provider and the institution.

It should be clarified whether the approval is of a general nature or if the institution should grant its approval to each case of sub- outsourcing.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:114]
PARAGRAPH_103852: Several respondents requested clarification on whether the sub- contractor is not and should not be directly engaged with the institution. If this is the case, the obligations of paragraph 66 should be undertaken by the direct service provider on behalf of the sub-contractor. Several respondents asked whether the requirements apply to direct sub-contractors or to the whole chain of sub-outsourcing. In the latter case, respondents consider that it would be difficult to achieve compliance when sub-contractors provide only small parts of services. The requirements should therefore be proportionate to the role fulfilled and activity performed.

PARAGRAPH_103853: The sub-contractor is not obliged to directly engage with the institution. Institutions and service providers can organise the internal relationships themselves.

PARAGRAPH_103878: In the case of outsourcing to cloud service providers and other outsourcing arrangements that involve the handling or transfer of personal or confidential data, institutions and payment institutions should adopt a risk-based approach to data storage and data processing location(s) (i.e. country or region) and information security considerations. In this particular case, 'risk- based approach' means that the risks related to the location and storage of data should be considered and managed in the light of the nature of the data (i.e. personal, confidential, non- confidential, public, etc.).

PARAGRAPH_103881: One respondent suggested that the language be aligned with the cloud recommendation, in particular regarding the fact that service providers should comply with requirements regarding the protection of data that are applicable to them and not with requirements applicable to institutions. One respondent considered that the guidelines should recognise service providers' confidentiality obligations to other clients, security concerns, competition issues (e.g. audits by competitors) and professional obligations.

PARAGRAPH_103882: The guidelines are addressed to institutions and not to service providers. The guidelines recognise multi-tenant environments.

PARAGRAPH_103956: Some respondents asked why the guidelines referenced national law when clarifying what is meant by cross-border outsourcing arrangements and asked if that law applies to the institution or to the service provider. Some respondents suggested that the governing law of the agreement be referred to instead. Some respondents considered that the guidelines should require that reasonable termination rights be included in the agreement, but should not specify termination events, as some expectations of the guidelines, such as termination rights in the case of a breach of contract or any weakness of IT security, are not in line with some national laws and would be unenforceable.

PARAGRAPH_104011: In addition, respondents suggested that specificities of intragroup outsourcing arrangements be better reflected: since the likelihood that a service provider inside the group will be terminated or will fail is extremely low, greater visibility and cooperation is available and adjustments to intragroup arrangements are covered by business continuity plans. An institution may also not be in a position to exit an arrangement if this would conflict with the group policy or governance.

PARAGRAPH_104038: Some respondents considered that there should not be additional new reporting requirements for payment and electronic money institutions. Such institutions are already subject to the PSD2 notification requirements and should not be required to have a register. Several respondents considered that intragroup outsourcing arrangements should be excluded from the information requirements. In particular, in IPSs or cooperatives in which a high number of affiliated institutions outsource the same function, providing the same set of information does not have added value.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:121]
PARAGRAPH_104039: The guidelines specify that payment and electronic money institutions already need to document all outsourcing arrangements. The register should be made available on request. See comment on groups/IPSs. A centralised register can be kept.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:122]
PARAGRAPH_104049: Some respondents considered that making a full register available within each SREP or at least every three years represents a significant volume of information that does not allow for risk-sensitive supervision. A high number of respondents made the following suggestions: that transmission be limited when supervisors request an inspection, that a waiver be provided for small institutions, that the scope of the register be reduced to critical and important functions and that the information required be limited (i.e. a brief description of the function, its criticality, contact details of the provider), with competent authorities then able to ask for more details when necessary. Several respondents asked for confirmation that no prior approval by the competent authority is necessary for an outsourcing arrangement. The requirement to inform competent authorities about outsourcing arrangements should be removed or at least changed to an ex post notification.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:122]
PARAGRAPH_104050: The register should be available upon request. The contents of the register have been streamlined, in particular for non- material outsourcing arrangements. See also comments on the register and in Section 11 on documentation. The guidelines do neither require nor prevent competent authorities from applying a prior approval process for outsourcing arrangements. Supervision is done on a risk-based approach and, depending on the size and complexity of institutions, a different frequency for reviews is applied. Institutions and payment institutions should adequately inform competent authorities in a timely manner or engage in a supervisory dialogue with regard to planned outsourcing of critical or important functions and/or where an outsourced function has become critical or important.

PARAGRAPH_104069: One respondent considered that this section should be integrated into the EBA SREP guidelines. One respondent wanted to add that competent and resolution authorities, and digital service providers' supervisory authorities, should cooperate for the monitoring of outsourcing risks.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:123]
PARAGRAPH_104070: These guidelines should be read in conjunction with the SREP guidelines. These guidelines are addressed to competent authorities. However, references and links to the BRRD framework are given where relevant. In particular, where risk concentrations are identified that pose risks to the stability of the financial market, the resolution authority should be informed about the new potential critical function (i.e. 'critical function' as defined under the BRRD).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:123]
PARAGRAPH_104074: Concentration risks within an institution, including on a consolidated basis, caused by multiple outsourcing arrangements with a single service provider, closely connected service providers or multiple outsourcing arrangements within the same business area should be considered and assessed on a macro level by the competent authority.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:123] [RISK:CONCENTRATION_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_104077: Several respondents asked for a clarification on if and how competent authorities would inform entities about their calculation of concentration risk at a sector level, and what the consequences would be of evidence of a concentration risk, e.g. in the provision of cloud-based outsourced services.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:123] [RISK:CONCENTRATION_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_104078: Competent authorities should maintain a dialogue with the supervised entities. However, the concentration risk is assessed by competent authorities to identify risks for the financial stability; no public communication is required.

PARAGRAPH_104080: Paragraph 105

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:123] [RISK:BUSINESS_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_104081: Some respondents asked the EBA to better describe the situations in which a competent authority could ask an institution to exit from an arrangement to limit the business risk. The requirement to exit should be a last resort and prior steps and warnings should be defined as part of a supervisor's policy and made public by competent authorities.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:123]
PARAGRAPH_104082: No further clarification can be provided. The measures of competent authorities need to take into account in the situation in question. General principles of administrative law apply. This does not need to be specified in EBA guidelines.

PARAGRAPH_104098: Some respondents considered that the impact assessment failed to demonstrate that the benefits outweighed the costs. The latter are underestimated, as the guidelines will trigger significant financial, IT and administrative costs and an increased workload in terms of updating contracts, processes and procedures and performing on-going controls. Specific one-off costs identified include the design and set up of a database, the analysis of all contracts and the drafting of new clauses. Some respondents considered that the assessment underestimates the resources that will be necessary to maintain the register for all arrangements and for competent authorities to process the registers.
