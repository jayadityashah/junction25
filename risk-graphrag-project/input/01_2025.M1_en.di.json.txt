PARAGRAPH_31265: (9) The example data sample consists of a total of 6,002 credits, including 5,787 good credits and 215 bad credits. The data are divided into 20 buckets by risk score on the credit granting date so that each bucket has approximately 300 credits. In the table, the cumulative percentage shares of all credits and bad credits are calculated, starting from the highest-risk 5% bucket with the lowest but still approved risk scores. All credits are divided broadly evenly into the 5% buckets, but the share of bad credits in each bucket varies, being higher in the higher-risk buckets than in the lower-risk buckets.

PARAGRAPH_31307: (11) In Chart 1, the horizontal axis represents the cumulative proportion of approved credits out of total credits, starting from the highest-risk 5% bucket, while the vertical axis represents the corresponding proportion of bad credits. The area aR is approximated by first forming a bar between each 5% bucket, where the width of the horizontal axis represents the relative proportion of each bucket (here: 5%). The height of the bar indicates the average share of bad credits in these two buckets. For example, the width of the bar between the 5% and 10% score buckets is 5, and its height, on a rounded basis, is 14+26.5 = 20,2 (see Table 1 column "Cumulative share of bad credits between groups on average, %"). 2

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:FIVA_MOK] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:10]
PARAGRAPH_31308: (12) The area of the entire scoring model is determined by calculating the sum of the areas of each bar (width of the bar multiplied by its height). In the example, the area of bad credits is 7,587.2, where the area above the area of a random model aR is 7587,2 - 5000 = 2587,2. The area falling below a random model is exactly 5,000 because it constitutes half of the potential area of the entire chart 100-100 5,000). 2
