PARAGRAPH_32200: Executive Summary

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:FIVA_MOK] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:31]
PARAGRAPH_32201: 1. CESR delivered its advice to the European Commission on the format and content of Key Information Document disclosures in October 2009 (Ref. CESR/09-949). That advice was supplemented by two detailed technical methodologies on the risk and re- ward indicator (Ref. CESR/09-1026) and the ongoing charges figure (Ref. CESR/09- 1028) that were delivered in December 2009. The Commission has indicated that it sees these methodologies as being more appropriately adopted via binding technical standards by the new European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) rather than as level 2 implementing measures. During the period leading up to the establishment of ESMA, CESR has agreed to adopt the methodologies as level 3 guidelines in order to provide clarity to the industry in implementing the new package of UCITS require- ments.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:FIVA_MOK] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:31] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_32202: 2. The methodology for calculation of the ongoing charges figure set out in these guide- lines applies to all UCITS and aims at ensuring a harmonised approach to the calcula- tion of this figure, thereby enabling investors to compare UCITS more easily. The methodology identifies clearly which items should be included in the ongoing charges figure. There is a presumption that all costs borne by the fund must be taken into ac- count unless they are explicitly excluded, while performance-related fees and transac- tion costs are among the costs excluded from the calculation (as are entry and exit charges borne by the investor). An ex-post calculation based on audited accounts should be used wherever possible. The methodology also takes account of the adaptation necessary in the case of new funds, or where there is a significant change to the costs of an existing fund.

PARAGRAPH_32211: Background and introduction

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:FIVA_MOK] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:32] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_32212: 1. In its technical advice to the European Commission on the Key Information Document for UCITS (CESR/09-949), published on 28 October 2009 (hereafter the Advice), CESR made a number of recommendations on an improved approach to charges dis- closure, including a clearer separation of the different types of charge and a harmo- nised approach to their presentation. As part of this, CESR proposed that each UCITS disclose in its Key Investor Information a single figure representing all annual charges and other payments taken from the assets of the UCITS on a periodic basis. This fig- ure, to be referred to as the 'ongoing charges figure', was to be calculated using a harmonised methodology. CESR submitted that methodology to the Commission as part of the package of level 2 advice delivered in December 2009 (Ref. CESR/09- 1028). CESR also published a feedback statement setting out how the respons- es to the consultation had been reflected in the advice (Ref. CESR/09-995).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:FIVA_MOK] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:32] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_32213: 2. Following submission of CESR's advice, the European Commission began work to prepare the level 2 implementing measures that would support the requirements of the revised UCITS Directive (2009/65/EC) at level 1. The advice that CESR submitted on charges disclosure - in particular Section 5 of Ref. CESR/09-949 - was incorporated into the level 2 implementing measures without any substantive changes to the con- tent. This is reflected in Articles 10 to 14, 24, 30, 33 and Annex II of the KII implement- ing Regulation1.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:FIVA_MOK] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:32]
PARAGRAPH_32214: 3. During the preparation of the implementing measures, the Commission explained that the technical methodologies, which it considered formed a central element of the ad- vice, would not be best suited to delivery by means of measures at level 2, but instead as binding technical standards under the new EU supervisory framework. This covers both the detailed methodology for calculating each UCITS' ongoing charg- es figure and the methodology for calculation of the synthetic risk and reward indicator (on the latter, see document Ref. CESR/10-673).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:FIVA_MOK] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:32]
PARAGRAPH_32215: 4. The Commission considers the methodologies an important element in the op- eration and uniform application of the requirements on Key Investor Information and takes the view that they should be harmonised and legally binding on all UCITS. The Commission has further acknowledged that, due to their highly technical features which are tailored to the current market, it is likely that the methodologies will require work by CESR in the future to reflect developments in the market in an appropriate and timely manner. This will allow sufficient flexibility in monitoring the application of the methodologies over time and appropriate adjustments to be made.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:FIVA_MOK] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:32]
PARAGRAPH_32216: 5. Taking these points into account, the Commission decided that it would be preferable to allow the future European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to adopt the methodologies as technical standards in their entirety. In the interim, CESR has agreed to adopt the methodologies as level 3 guidelines. This provides clarity and certainty to the industry for the purposes of implementing the new UCITS requirements as a package. Stakeholders should note that the substance of the methodology itself has not changed and is exactly the same as the version published on 22 December 2009 (Ref. CESR/09-1028).

However, in the specific case of a UCITS investing in other CIUs, any fee-sharing agreement between the management company of the UCITS and the CIU or its operator or management company shall be taken into ac- count if it is not already captured under paragraph 8 below.
