PARAGRAPH_26695: (1) Outsourcing is a way of arranging supervised entities' activities, covered by financial market regulation. By outsourcing, supervised entities may seek to increase the efficiency, flexibility and competitiveness of their operations. However, responsibility for outsourced activities remains with the supervised entity, and therefore supervised entities' internal control and risk management must also extend to outsourced activities. Supervised entities must send the FIN- FSA an advance notification of intentions to outsource material activities.
