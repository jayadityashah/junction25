PARAGRAPH_81784: 1. Executive Summary

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_81785: These guidelines are issued pursuant to Article 16(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 on the EBA's own initiative in order to ensure common, uniform and consistent application of Union law and to establish consistent, efficient and effective supervisory practices within the European System of Financial Supervision ('ESFS').

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_81786: A significant number of credit institutions apply the International Financial Reporting Standards® ('IFRS® Standards') as these are incorporated into the EU legal framework through EU regulations, in accordance with the procedures set out in Regulation (EC) No 1606/20021. IFRS 9 Financial Instruments ('IFRS 9'), which will replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement ('IAS 39'), for the accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 20182, requires the measurement of impairment loss allowances to be based on an expected credit loss ('ECL') accounting model rather than on an incurred loss accounting model.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_81787: The EBA welcomes the move from an incurred loss model to an ECL model under IFRS 93. IFRS 9 is, overall, an improvement compared with IAS 39 in the accounting for financial instruments, and the changes to credit loss provisioning should contribute to addressing the G20's concerns about the issue of 'too little, too late' recognition of credit losses, and improve the accounting recognition of loan loss provisions by incorporating a broader range of credit information. IFRS 9 is therefore expected to address some prudential concerns and contribute to financial stability. However, the application of IFRS 9 also requires the use of judgement in the ECL assessment and measurement process, which could potentially affect the consistent application of IFRS 9 across credit institutions and the comparability of credit institutions' financial statements.

PARAGRAPH_81788: In December 2015, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ('BCBS') issued supervisory guidance on credit risk and accounting for expected credit losses4 (the 'BCBS guidance'), which sets out supervisory expectations for credit institutions related to sound credit risk practices associated with implementing and applying an ECL accounting model. In addition, it contains an Annex specific to jurisdictions applying IFRS.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]

PARAGRAPH_81797: high-quality and consistent application of IFRS 9 and could help to promote consistent interpretations and practices. The objective of the EBA guidelines is to be in line with the BCBS guidance. The EBA guidelines would not prevent credit institutions from meeting the impairment requirements in IFRS 9.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_81798: These guidelines should be read in conjunction with the provisions of Regulation (EU) 575/2013 and Directive 2013/36/EU regarding internal governance, credit risk, disclosures, supervisory review and evaluation process and requirements, and supervisory measures and powers, as supplemented by the relevant technical standards adopted by the Commission and as further developed by the technical standards and guidelines issued by the EBA.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_81799: The guidelines include four main sections as follows:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_81800: " Section 4.1 includes some general considerations on the application of the principles of proportionality and materiality, and the use of information by credit institutions.

PARAGRAPH_81801: " Section 4.2 includes eight principles, also addressed to credit institutions, which relate to the provisions for the main elements of credit risk management and accounting for ECL, and provide detailed guidance for the application of each principle.

PARAGRAPH_81803: " Section 4.4 includes three principles, specifically addressed to competent authorities, on the supervisory evaluation of credit risk management practices, accounting for ECL and the overall capital adequacy.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_81804: In addition, these guidelines should be applied with the principle of proportionality in mind. The EBA notes that all credit institutions applying IFRS 9 should ensure that they meet the objectives of IFRS 9 when applying the standard. Credit institutions should comply with these guidelines in a proportionate manner taking into account various criteria, such as their size and internal organisation and the nature, scope and complexity of their activities and portfolios, as described in paragraph 17 of the guidelines. Credit institutions should, however, take into consideration if using practical expedients that the objective of IFRS 9 is to measure ECL to reflect an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes (IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.17).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_81805: The draft guidelines were subject to a three-month consultation period between July 2016 and October 2016. The EBA received 17 responses to the draft guidelines, overall supporting the content of the draft guidelines, subject to additional clarifications mainly on the application of the proportionality principle, the scope of application of the guidelines and the use of practical expedients. The EBA assessed the arguments presented in the responses in order to decide whether any amendments were necessary before issuing the final guidelines. The result of this assessment is included in the feedback section of this paper.

PARAGRAPH_81819: 2. In particular, Article 74 of Directive 2013/36/EU6 requires credit institutions to have 'adequate internal control mechanisms, including sound administration and accounting procedures ... that are consistent with and promote sound and effective risk management'. Article 79(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU requires competent authorities to ensure that '(b) institutions have internal methodologies that enable them to assess the credit risk of exposures to individual obligors ... and credit risk at the portfolio level' and '(c) the ongoing administration and monitoring of the various risk-bearing portfolios and exposures of institutions, including for identifying and managing problem credits and for making adequate value adjustments and provisions, is operated through effective systems'. Article 88(1)(b) of Directive 2013/36/EU also includes the principle that 'the management body must ensure the integrity of the accounting and financial reporting systems, including financial and operational controls and compliance with the law and relevant standards'. In accordance with Article 97(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU, competent authorities must review the arrangements, strategies, processes and mechanisms implemented by institutions to comply with that Directive and Regulation (EU) No 575/20137. In this regard, Article 104(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU enumerates the minimum powers that competent authorities must have, including the power 'to require the reinforcement of the arrangements, processes, mechanisms and strategies implemented in accordance with Articles 73 and 74' (Article 104(1)(b)), 'to require institutions to apply a specific provisioning policy or treatment of assets in terms of own funds requirements' (Article 104(1)(d)).

PARAGRAPH_81821: 4. Accounting frameworks are commonly principles-based and credit institutions should exercise judgement when applying the standards, with the objective of providing useful financial information to the users.

In addition, a significant number of credit institutions apply the IFRS Standards as these are incorporated into the EU legal framework through EU Regulations, in accordance with the procedures set out in Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002. IFRS 9, which will replace IAS 39 for the accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 20188, requires the measurement of impairment loss provisions to be based on an ECL accounting model rather than on an incurred loss accounting model.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_81831: 7. The ECL model should result in the earlier recognition of credit losses. In this respect, IFRS 9 is expected to address some prudential concerns and contribute to financial stability. In addition, consideration of forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors, is a distinctive feature of an ECL model and is critical for the timely recognition of credit losses. The ECL model is also more aligned with existing regulatory practices (for credit institutions using an internal ratings-based ('IRB') approach) which require the calculation of expected credit losses rather than incurred credit losses in order to determine institutions' regulatory capital requirements.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_81832: 8. However, the application of IFRS 9 also requires the use of judgement in the ECL assessment and measurement process, which could potentially affect the consistent application of IFRS 9 across institutions and the comparability of credit institutions' financial statements. Therefore, the existence of supervisory guidance emphasises the importance of high-quality and consistent application of IFRS 9 and could help to promote consistent interpretations and practices.

PARAGRAPH_81842: 11. Recognising that credit institutions may have well-established regulatory capital models for the measurement of expected losses, these models may be used as a starting point for estimating ECL for accounting purposes; however, regulatory capital models may not be directly usable in the measurement of accounting ECL because of differences between the objectives of, and inputs used for, each of these purposes.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:9] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_81843: 12.As with all EBA guidelines, these guidelines should be read holistically with the understanding that the examples provided are not all-inclusive and that a checklist approach to applying these guidelines is not intended. While these guidelines are to be applied for the assessment of credit risk from, and the measurement of ECL on, lending exposures under the applicable accounting framework, they do not set out principles and expectations targeted at specific categories of loans such as corporate, retail and project finance. In this regard, certain aspects of the guidelines may be more applicable to the individual credit assessment of a large corporate borrower, while other aspects may be more relevant to collective assessments of a particular group of retail customers.

PARAGRAPH_81846: 14.In particular, on the considerations on proportionate application of the EBA guidelines, the EBA notes that all credit institutions applying IFRS 9 should ensure that they meet the objectives of IFRS 9 when applying the standard. However, the EBA understands that the way of meeting these objectives may differ across credit institutions; for example, different techniques or models may be used in the measurement of ECL. Credit institutions should comply with these guidelines in a proportionate manner taking into account various criteria, such as their size and internal organisation and the nature, scope and complexity of their activities and portfolios, as described in paragraph 17 of the guidelines. Credit institutions should, however, take into consideration if using practical expedients that the objective of IFRS 9 is to estimate ECL to reflect an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes (IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.17)

PARAGRAPH_81924: 17. Credit institutions should comply with these guidelines in a manner that is appropriate to their size and internal organisation and the nature, scope and complexity of their activities and portfolios, and, more generally, all other relevant facts and circumstances of the credit institution (and the group (if any) to which it belongs). The use of properly designed proportionate approaches should not jeopardise the high-quality implementation of the ECL accounting frameworks.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:17]
PARAGRAPH_81925: 18. Credit institutions should also give due consideration to the application of the principle of materiality. However, this should not result in individual exposures or portfolios being considered immaterial if, cumulatively, these represent a material exposure to the credit institution. In addition, materiality should not be assessed only on the basis of the potential impact on the profit or loss statement at the reporting date. For instance, large portfolio(s) of lending exposures such as real estate mortgages would generally be considered material even if they are highly collateralised.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:17] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_81926: 19. In considering how to take proportionality or materiality into account in the design of an ECL methodology or in its implementation, it is important to ensure that bias is not being introduced.

PARAGRAPH_81927: 20. The timely recognition of credit deterioration and allowances should not be delayed without prejudice to the fact that ECL accounting frameworks are symmetrical in the way that subsequent changes (both deteriorations and reversals of those deteriorations) in the credit risk profile of a debtor should be considered in the measurement of the allowances.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:18]
PARAGRAPH_81935: 22. In order to ensure a timely recognition of credit losses, credit institutions should consider forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors. When considering forward- looking information, credit institutions should apply sound judgement consistent with generally accepted methods for economic analysis and forecasting, and supported by a sufficient set of data.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:18] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_81936: 23. Credit institutions should be able to demonstrate how they have considered relevant, reasonable and supportable information in the ECL assessment and measurement process. Credit institutions should apply experienced credit judgement in the consideration of future scenarios and take into account the potential consequence of events occurring or not occurring, and the resulting impact on the measurement of ECL. Information should not be excluded from that process simply because an event has a low likelihood of occurring or the effect of that event on the credit risk or the amount of expected credit losses is uncertain. In certain circumstances information relevant to the assessment and measurement of credit risk may not be reasonable and supportable and should therefore be excluded from the ECL assessment and measurement process. Given that these circumstances would be exceptional in nature, credit institutions should provide a clearly documented, robust justification.

PARAGRAPH_82058: a. Credit institutions should take into account the following criteria regarding renegotiations/modifications of lending exposures:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:27] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82059: i. The allowance methodology should enable credit institutions to perform a robust assessment of credit risk and measurement of ECL such that the allowance level continues to reflect the collectability of the substance of the renegotiated/modified exposure, irrespective of whether or not the original asset is derecognised under the applicable accounting framework.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:27] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82060: ii. Renegotiations/modifications should not automatically lead to the conclusion that there has been an immediate decrease in the credit risk of the exposure. Any decrease in the reported allowance level due to improved credit risk should be supported by strong evidence. Customers should demonstrate consistently satisfactory payment performance over a reasonable period of time before credit risk would be considered to have decreased, considering also the relevant requirements for exposures in the probation period as defined in Part 2 of Annex V of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 680/2014.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:27] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82061: iii. Credit institutions should carefully consider whether the collection of loan principal is reasonably assured when repayment performance takes the form of interest payments alone, subsequent to a renegotiation or modification. In addition, further expected delays in the payment of those cash flows may evidence that credit risk has not improved, and thus the level of ECL should be reassessed carefully.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:27]
PARAGRAPH_82062: iv. The methodologies should also call upon the lending staff to promptly notify the institution's accounting function when exposures are renegotiated or modified to ensure appropriate accounting for the change. For more complex renegotiations and modifications, regular communication between the lending staff and the accounting function should take place.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:28] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_82072: 42. As part of its credit risk assessment process, credit institutions should have in place comprehensive procedures and information systems to monitor the quality of their lending exposures. These include an effective credit risk rating process that captures the varying level, nature and drivers of credit risk that may manifest themselves over time, in order to reasonably ensure that all lending exposures are properly monitored and that ECL allowances are appropriately measured.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:28] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82073: 43. The credit risk rating process should include an independent review function. Initial assignment of credit risk grades to exposures and their ongoing updating by front-line lending staff should be subject to the review of the independent review function.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:28] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82074: 44. Credit institutions should take into account a number of criteria when assigning the credit risk grade upon initial recognition of a lending exposure including, to the extent relevant, product type, terms and conditions, collateral type and amount, borrower characteristics and geography or a combination thereof.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:28] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82075: 45. When changing existing credit risk grades assigned, on either a portfolio or an individual basis, credit institutions should take into account other relevant factors such as, but not limited to, changes in industry outlook, business growth rates, consumer sentiment and changes in economic forecasts (such as interest rates, unemployment rates and commodity prices) as well as weaknesses in underwriting identified after initial recognition.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:28] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82076: 46. The credit risk rating system should capture all lending exposures when assessing the impact of changes in credit risk, and not only those that may have experienced significant increases in credit risk, have incurred losses or are otherwise credit impaired. This is to allow for an appropriate differentiation of credit risk and grouping of lending exposures within the credit risk rating system, and to reflect the risk of individual exposures as well as, when aggregated across all exposures, the level of credit risk in the portfolio as a whole. In this context, an effective credit risk rating system should allow credit institutions to identify both migration of credit risk and significant changes in credit risk.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:28] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82077: 47.

PARAGRAPH_82084: 49. Credit institutions should group exposures with shared credit risk characteristics in a way that is sufficiently granular to be able to reasonably assess changes in credit risk and thus the impact on the estimate of ECL for these groups.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_82085: 50. A credit institution's methodology for grouping exposures to assess credit risk (such as by instrument type, product terms and conditions, industry/market segment, geographical location or vintages) should be documented and subject to appropriate review and internal approval by senior management.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_82086: 51. Lending exposures should be grouped according to shared credit risk characteristics so that changes in the level of credit risk respond to the impact of changing conditions on a common range of credit risk drivers. This includes considering the effect on the group's credit risk in response to changes in forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors. The basis of grouping should be reviewed by senior management to ensure that exposures within the group remain homogeneous in terms of their response to credit risk drivers and that the relevant credit risk characteristics and their impact on the level of credit risk for the group have not changed over time.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82087: 52. Exposures should not be grouped in such a way that an increase in the credit risk of particular exposures is obscured by the performance of the group as a whole.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82088: 53. Credit institutions should have in place a robust process to ensure appropriate initial grouping of their lending exposures. Subsequently, the grouping of exposures should be re-evaluated and exposures should be re-segmented if relevant new information is received or a credit institution's changed expectations of credit risk suggest that a permanent adjustment is warranted. If a credit institution is not able to re-segment exposures on a timely basis, a temporary adjustment should be used.

PARAGRAPH_82089: Use of temporary adjustments

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82090: 54. Credit institutions should use temporary adjustments to an allowance only as an interim solution, in particular in transient circumstances or when there is insufficient time to appropriately incorporate relevant new information into the existing credit risk rating and modelling process, or to re-segment existing groups of lending exposures, or when lending exposures within a group of lending exposures react to factors or events differently than initially expected.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:30]
PARAGRAPH_82094: 55. Such adjustments should not be continuously used over the long term for a non-transient risk factor. If the reason for the adjustment is not expected to be temporary, such as the emergence of a new risk driver that has not previously been incorporated into the institution's allowance methodology, the methodology should be updated in the near term to incorporate the factor that is expected to have an ongoing impact on the measurement of ECL.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:30]
PARAGRAPH_82095: 56. The use of temporary adjustments requires the application of significant judgement and creates the potential for bias. In order to avoid the creation of potential for bias, temporary adjustments should be directionally consistent with forward-looking forecasts, supported by appropriate documentation, and subject to appropriate governance processes.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:30]
PARAGRAPH_82097: A credit institution's aggregate amount of allowances, regardless of whether allowances are determined on a collective or an individual basis, should be adequate and consistent with the objectives of the applicable accounting framework.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:30] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_82098: 57. Credit institutions should implement sound credit risk methodologies with the objective that the overall balance of the allowance for ECL is developed in accordance with the applicable accounting framework and adequately reflects ECL within that framework.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:30]
PARAGRAPH_82099: 58. When assessing the adequacy of the allowances credit institutions should take into account relevant factors and expectations at the reporting date that may affect the collectability of remaining cash flows over the life of a group of lending exposures or a single lending exposure. Credit institutions should consider information which goes beyond historical and current data, and take into account reasonable and supportable forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors, that are relevant to the exposure(s) being evaluated (for example retail or wholesale) in accordance with the applicable accounting framework.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:30]
PARAGRAPH_82100: 59. Depending on the ability to incorporate forward-looking information into the ECL estimate, credit institutions may use individual or collective assessment approaches; regardless of the assessment approach used, they should be consistent with the relevant accounting requirements and not result in materially different allowance measurements. Together, individual and collective assessments form the basis for the allowance for ECL.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:30] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82101: 60. The ECL assessment approach used should be the most appropriate in the particular circumstances, and typically should be aligned with how the credit institution manages the lending exposure. For example, collective assessment is often used for large groups of homogeneous lending exposures with shared credit risk characteristics, such as retail portfolios. Individual assessments are often conducted for significant exposures, or where credit concerns have been identified at the individual loan level, such as watch list and past due loans.

PARAGRAPH_82105: 61. Regardless of the assessment approach it uses (individual or collective), a credit institution should ensure this does not result in delayed recognition of ECL.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:31] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82106: 62. When credit institutions use individual assessments, the ECL estimate should always incorporate the expected impact of all reasonable and supportable forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors, that affect collectability and credit risk. When applying an individual assessment approach, in the same manner as in the case of collective assessment, the credit institution's documentation should clearly demonstrate how forward- looking information, including macroeconomic factors, has been reflected in the individual assessment.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:31] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82107: 63. In cases when a credit institution's individual assessments of exposures do not adequately consider forward-looking information, and in order to allow identification of relationships between forward-looking information and ECL estimates that may not be apparent at the individual level, an institution should group lending exposures with shared credit risk characteristics to estimate the impact of forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors. Conversely, when credit institutions determine that all reasonable and supportable forward-looking information has been incorporated in the individual assessment of ECL, an additional forward-looking assessment should not be conducted on a collective basis if that could result in double counting.

PARAGRAPH_82110: 64. Credit institutions may use in the ECL assessment and measurement process models and assumption-based estimates for risk identification and measurement, at both the individual lending exposure and overall portfolio levels, including credit grading, credit risk identification, measurement of ECL allowances for accounting purposes, stress testing and capital allocation. Models used in the ECL assessment and measurement process should consider the impact of changes to borrower and credit risk-related variables such as changes in PDs, LGDs, exposure amounts, collateral values, migration of default probabilities and internal borrower credit risk grades based on historical, current, and reasonable and supportable forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors.

PARAGRAPH_82117: a. Clear roles and responsibilities for model validation with adequate independence and competence. Model validation should be performed independently of the model development process and by staff with the necessary experience and expertise. The findings and outcomes of model validation should be reported in a prompt and timely manner to the appropriate level of authority. Where a credit institution has outsourced its validation function to an external party, the credit institution remains responsible for the effectiveness of all model validation work and should ensure that the work done by the external party meets the elements of a sound model validation framework on an ongoing basis.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:32]
PARAGRAPH_82118: b. An appropriate model validation scope and methodology should include a systematic process of evaluating the model's robustness, consistency and accuracy as well as its continued relevance to the underlying individual lending exposure or portfolio. An effective model validation process should also enable potential limitations of a model to be identified and addressed on a timely basis. The scope for validation should include a review of model inputs, model design and model outputs/performance.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:32] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_82119: · Model inputs: Credit institutions should have internally established quality and reliability standards on data (historical, current and forward-looking information) used as model inputs. Data used to estimate ECL allowances should be relevant to the credit institutions' portfolios and, as far as possible, accurate, reliable and complete (i.e. without exclusions that could bias ECL estimates).

PARAGRAPH_82120: · Model design: For model design, validation should assess that the underlying theory of the model is conceptually sound, recognised and generally accepted for its intended purpose.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:33] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82130: 68. Credit institutions should have the necessary tools to ensure a robust estimate and timely recognition of ECL. Given that information on historical loss experience or the impact of current conditions may not fully reflect the credit risk in lending exposures, credit institutions should use their experienced credit judgement to thoroughly incorporate the expected impact of all reasonable and supportable forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors, on its estimate of ECL. A credit institution's use of its experienced credit judgement should be documented in the credit institution's credit risk methodology and subject to appropriate oversight.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:33] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_82131: 69. Historical information provides a useful basis for the identification of trends and correlations needed to identify the credit risk drivers for lending exposures. However, ECL estimates must not ignore the impact of (forward-looking) events and conditions on those drivers. The estimate should reflect the expected future cash shortfalls resulting from such impact.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:33]
PARAGRAPH_82132: 70. Consideration of forward-looking information should not be avoided on the basis that a credit institution considers the cost of incorporating such forward-looking information to be very high or unnecessary or because there is uncertainty in formulating forward-looking scenarios, unless the additional cost and operational burden to be introduced do not contribute to a high-quality implementation of an ECL accounting framework.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:33] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82133: 71. Credit institutions should be able to demonstrate that the forward-looking information factored into the ECL estimation process has a link to the credit risk drivers for particular exposures or portfolios. Given that it may not be possible to demonstrate a strong link in formal statistical terms between certain types of information, or even the information set as a whole, and the credit risk drivers, credit institutions should use their experienced credit judgement in establishing an appropriate level for the individual or collective allowance. When a forward-looking factor that has been identified as relevant is not incorporated into the individual or collective assessment, temporary adjustments may be necessary.

Macroeconomic forecasts and other relevant information should be applied consistently across portfolios where the credit risk drivers of the portfolios are affected by these forecasts/assumptions in the same way.

PARAGRAPH_82167: 86. In accordance with paragraph 5.5.5 of IFRS 9, 'if, at the reporting date, the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, an entity shall measure the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses'. Credit institutions should measure ECL for all lending exposures and a nil allowance should be rare because ECL estimates are a probability-weighted amount that should always reflect the possibility that a credit loss will occur (see paragraphs 5.5.17 and 5.5.18 of IFRS 9). A nil allowance could however occur, for example, for fully collateralised loans (although credit institutions should be cautious when developing estimates of collateral value, as valuation of collateral at origination may change over the life of the loan).

Credit institutions must also note that, in accordance with IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.9, to assess whether a financial instrument should move to a lifetime ECL measure, the change in the risk of a default occurring over the expected life of the financial instrument must be considered. In some circumstances, IFRS 9 allows changes in the risk of a default occurring over the next 12 months to be used to make this assessment; however, this may not always be appropriate, and particular attention should be given to the examples set out in IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.14.

PARAGRAPH_82175: 89. IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.37, does not define default, but requires credit institutions to define default in a manner consistent with that used for internal credit risk management. IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.37, also includes a rebuttable presumption that default does not occur later than 90 days past due. When adopting a definition of default for accounting purposes, credit institutions should be guided by the definition used for regulatory purposes provided in Article 178 of Regulation (EU) 575/201329, which includes both:

PARAGRAPH_82178: 90. In accordance with Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013, a default event shall be considered to have occurred with regard to a particular obligor when either of the criteria in paragraphs 4(a) and (b) is met, or both are met. In this context, credit institutions should identify default, in accordance with the 'unlikeliness to pay' criterion of the debtor, before the exposure becomes delinquent with the 90-days-past-due criterion. In line with the approach followed for regulatory purposes, the list of elements provided in Article 178(3) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013 as indications of unlikeliness to pay should be implemented in a way that ensures a timely detection of 'unlikeliness to pay' events that precipitate eventual cash shortfalls. As regards the criterion in paragraph 4(b), although for regulatory purposes in the case of retail and public sector entity obligations, for the 90-day figure competent authorities may substitute a figure of up to 180 days for different products, as it considers appropriate to local conditions (see Article 178(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013), this possibility should not be read as an exemption from the application of the 90-day rebuttable presumption in IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.37, for those exposures.

PARAGRAPH_82183: 91. In formulating the estimate of the amount equal to 12-month ECL, credit institutions should consider reasonable and supportable information, as referred to in the Definitions and in Principle 6 of these guidelines, that affect credit risk, especially forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors. Credit institutions should exercise experienced credit judgement to consider both qualitative and quantitative information that may affect the credit institution's assessment of credit risk. IFRS 9 provides that an entity does not need to undertake an exhaustive search for information when measuring an amount equal to 12- month ECL. However, credit institutions should actively incorporate information that may affect the estimate of ECL, and credit institutions should not exclude or ignore relevant information that is reasonably available.

PARAGRAPH_82185: 93. Even if an increase in credit risk is not judged to be significant, a credit institution should adjust its estimate of 12-month ECL to appropriately reflect changes in credit risk that have taken place.

In particular, where information becomes available to the credit institution indicating that further or different segmentation within a group of lending exposures is required, the group should be split into subgroups and the measurement of the amount equal to 12-month ECL should be updated separately for each subgroup or, in the case of transient circumstances, a temporary adjustment should be applied (see Principle 3 of these guidelines and its detailed requirements on the use of temporary adjustments). Where information becomes available which indicates that a particular subgroup has suffered a significant increase in credit risk, then lifetime ECL should be recognised in respect of that subgroup.

The rationale for this approach is that the creditworthiness of the counterparty, and thus the ECL anticipated upon initial recognition, is taken into account in the pricing of credit at that time. It follows, then, that a post-origination increase in credit risk may not be fully compensated by the interest rate charged, and, as a consequence, credit institutions should carefully consider whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk30. If so, the lending exposure should be subject to lifetime ECL measurement.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:39] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_82195: 98. In order to consider whether an exposure has suffered a significant increase in credit risk and the measurement of required 12-month ECL and lifetime ECL, credit institutions should have in place sound governance, systems and controls, in accordance with the principles specified in these guidelines. Unless already established, credit institutions should implement systems that are capable of handling and systematically assessing the large amounts of information that will be required to judge whether or not particular lending exposures or groups of lending exposures exhibit a significant increase in credit risk, and to measure lifetime ECL where that is the case. Parent undertakings and subsidiaries subject to Directive 2013/36/EU should ensure that the approach is consistent across the group. This should include, in particular, putting in place processes to ensure that forecasts of economic conditions in different jurisdictions and economic sectors are reviewed and approved by a credit institution's senior management, and that the process, controls and economic assumptions around developing forecasts and linking these to expectations of credit loss are consistent across the group. The need for consistency should not be interpreted as a requirement that the practice be identical across a group. On the contrary, within a consistent framework there may be differences across jurisdictions and products, depending for instance on the availability of data. These differences should be well documented and justified.

PARAGRAPH_82196: 99. Credit institutions' processes in place should enable them to determine on a timely and holistic basis whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk subsequent to the initial recognition of a lending exposure so that an individual exposure, or a group of exposures with similar credit risk characteristics, is transferred to lifetime ECL measurement as soon as credit risk has increased significantly, in accordance with the IFRS 9 impairment accounting requirements.

PARAGRAPH_82206: 102. IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.2, states that lifetime expected credit losses are generally expected to be recognised before a financial instrument becomes past due and that 'typically, credit risk increases significantly before a financial instrument becomes past due or other lagging borrower-specific factors (for example a modification or restructuring) are observed'. Therefore, credit institutions' analyses should take into account the fact that the determinants of credit losses very often begin to deteriorate a considerable time (months or, in some cases, years) before any objective evidence of delinquency appears in the lending exposures affected. Credit institutions should be mindful that delinquency data are generally backward-looking, and will seldom on their own be appropriate in the implementation of an ECL approach. For example, within retail portfolios adverse developments in macroeconomic factors and borrower attributes will generally lead to an increase in the level of credit risk long before this manifests itself in lagging information such as delinquency.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:40] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82207: 103. Thus, in order to meet the objective of IFRS 9 in a robust manner, credit institutions should also consider the linkages between macroeconomic factors and borrower attributes to the level of credit risk in a portfolio based on reasonable and supportable information. To that end, credit institutions should start with a detailed analysis of historical patterns and current trends, which would allow for identification of the most relevant credit risk drivers. Experienced credit judgement should facilitate the incorporation of current and forecasted conditions likely to affect those risk drivers, the expected cash shortfalls and therefore loss expectations.

Credit institutions should perform analyses of this kind not only in the context of portfolios of individually small credits, such as credit card exposures, but also for large, individually managed lending exposures. For example, for a large commercial property loan, credit institutions should take account of the considerable sensitivity of the commercial property market in many jurisdictions to the general macroeconomic environment, and consider using information such as levels of interest rates or vacancy rates to determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

PARAGRAPH_82212: 105. Credit institutions should have a clear policy including well-developed criteria on what constitutes a 'significant' increase in credit risk for different types of lending exposures. Such criteria and the reasons why these approaches and definitions are considered appropriate should be disclosed in accordance with IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, paragraph 35F. IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.9, requires that, when making the assessment of significant increases in credit risk, 'an entity shall use the change in the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial instrument instead of the change in the amount of expected credit losses'. For these purposes, institutions should make this assessment in terms of the risk of a default occurring and not expected credit loss (i.e. before consideration of the effects of credit risk mitigants such as collateral or guarantees).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:41] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82213: 106. In developing their approach to determining a significant increase in credit risk, credit institutions should consider each of the 16 classes of indicators in IFRS 9 (insofar as they are relevant to the financial instrument being assessed) as set out in paragraphs B5.5.17(a)-(p) and, in addition, credit institutions should consider whether there is further information that should be taken into account. Such indicators (in both IFRS 9 and these guidelines) should not be viewed as a 'checklist'. Some may be more relevant than others to assessing whether a particular type of lending exposure exhibits a significant increase in credit risk. At the same time, credit institutions should take particular care to avoid the risk of a significant increase in credit risk not being acknowledged promptly when it is, in fact, present. In particular, credit institutions should not restrict significant increases in credit risk to situations when a financial instrument is anticipated to become credit impaired (i.e. the third stage of IFRS 9 impairment requirements). Rather, debtors may exhibit a significant increase in credit risk without evidence that the related lending exposures are likely to become impaired. The fact that credit risk has increased significantly does not necessarily mean that default is probable - merely that it is more likely than at initial recognition. This point is underlined by the symmetry of the IFRS 9 model: it is possible for lending exposures to move to lifetime ECL but subsequently be moved back to 12-month ECL if the threshold of a significant increase in credit risk is no longer met.

PARAGRAPH_82224: While implementation of IFRS 9 should reflect credit risk management practices where possible, in some cases that would not be appropriate. If, for example, a credit institution manages most lending exposures in the same way regardless of credit risk - with the exception only of particularly strong or weak credits - the manner in which a lending exposure is managed is unlikely to be a sound indicator of whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

PARAGRAPH_82225: 108. When assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk for a lending exposure, credit institutions should also take into account the following factors which are related to the environment in which a credit institution or the borrower operates:

PARAGRAPH_82228: 109. Accurate identification of drivers of credit risk, and reliable demonstration of the linkages between those drivers and the level of credit risk, should be considered as critical, as a seemingly small change in a qualitative characteristic of a loan can potentially be a leading indicator of a large increase in the risk of a default occurring. Furthermore, in accordance with IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.9, the significance of a change in credit risk since initial recognition depends on the risk of a default occurring at initial recognition. In this regard, where a credit institution uses changes in PD as a means of identifying changes in the risk of a default occurring, it should take into consideration the significance of a given change in PD expressed in a ratio (or the rate of fluctuation) proportionate to the PD at initial recognition (i.e. a change in the PD divided by the PD at initial recognition), considering also paragraph B5.5.11

PARAGRAPH_82234: 110. Credit institutions should look beyond how many 'grades' a rating downgrade entails because the change in PD for a one-grade movement may not be linear (for example, the default probability over five years of an exposure rated BB is around three times that of one rated BBB, based on current data and analyses applicable to certain jurisdictions). Furthermore, because the significance of a one-grade movement would depend on the granularity of a bank's rating system - and hence the 'width' of each grade - an appropriate initial segmentation should be defined to ensure that a significant increase in credit risk for an individual lending exposure or a group of lending exposures is not obscured within a segment. In this regard, credit institutions should ensure that credit risk rating systems include a sufficient number of grades to appropriately distinguish credit risk. Credit institutions should also be mindful of the fact that a significant increase in credit risk could occur prior to a movement in a credit grade.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:43] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82235: 111. Credit institutions should take into account that there are some circumstances in which an adverse movement in the factors listed in paragraphs 107 and 108 above might not be indicative of a significant increase in credit risk. For example, it may be the case that the default probability of a lending exposure rated AA is low, and not much greater than one rated AAA. However, very few lending exposures are of such apparently low credit risk - and, as noted in paragraph 110, the sensitivity of default probability to rating grades may increase strongly as rating quality declines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:43] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82236: 112. Credit institutions should also be aware that there could be circumstances in which some factors move in an adverse direction but may be counterbalanced by improvement in others (see IFRS 9 Implementation Guidance, Example 2). Nonetheless, in view of the importance of detecting whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk, credit institutions should put in place governance and control processes capable of reliably validating any judgement that factors which may have an adverse impact on credit risk are counterbalanced by factors which may have a favourable impact.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:43] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82237: 113. Credit institutions should give thorough consideration and full weight to discretionary decisions by a credit institution's management body or senior management which point to a change in credit risk. For example, if because of concerns about credit risk a decision is made to intensify the monitoring of a borrower or class of borrowers, it is unlikely that such action would have been taken by the decision-maker had the increase in credit risk not been perceived as significant.

PARAGRAPH_82238: 114. When a credit institution assesses that there has been a significant increase in credit risk for some, but not all, of its lending exposures to a counterparty - for example, because of differences in the timing of when lending was provided - it should ensure that all lending exposures are identified where there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

PARAGRAPH_82242: 115. Where a credit institution makes the assessment of significant increases in credit risk on a collective basis (i.e. such as retail), the definitions of portfolios should be reviewed regularly to ensure that the lending exposures within them continue to share risk characteristics in terms of their response to credit risk drivers. Changing economic conditions may require regrouping.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:44] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82243: 116. In line with paragraph B5.5.1 of IFRS 9 on the assessment of significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition on a collective basis, in instances where it is apparent that, within a group of lending exposures, some lending exposures have experienced a significant increase in credit risk, credit institutions should transfer a subset or a proportion of the group of lending exposures to lifetime ECL measurement even though it is not possible to identify this on an individual lending exposure basis (see IFRS 9, Illustrative Example 5).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:44] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82244: 17. Consistent with paragraph B5.5.6 of IFRS 9 and paragraph IE39 of the Implementation Guidance for IFRS 9, if it is not possible on the basis of shared credit risk characteristics to identify a particular subgroup of lending exposures for which credit risk has increased significantly, an appropriate proportion of the overall group should be subject to lifetime ECL measurement.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:44] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82245: 118. 'Significant' should not be equated with statistical significance, meaning that the assessment approach should not be based solely on quantitative analysis. For portfolios which have a large number of individually small credits, and a rich set of relevant historical data, it may be possible to identify 'significant' increases in credit risk in part by using statistical techniques. However, for other lending exposures, that may not be feasible.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:44] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_82246: 119. 'Significant' should also not be judged in terms of the extent of impact on a credit institution's primary financial statements. Identification and disclosure of significant increases in credit risk should be undertaken, even where an increase in credit risk defined in terms of probability of default is unlikely to affect the allowance made - for example, because the exposure is more than fully collateralised - to allow credit institutions to identify and disclose such increases which are likely to be important to users seeking to understand trends in the intrinsic credit risk of a credit institution's lending exposures.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:44] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82247: 120. In accordance with IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.9, the assessment of significant increases in credit risk is based on comparing credit risk on exposures at the reporting date relative to credit risk upon initial recognition. IFRS 9, paragraph BC 5.161, and Illustrative Example 6 represent an example of the application of this principle in the Standard, rather than an exception to that principle. This example suggests that credit institutions can set a maximum credit risk for particular portfolios upon initial recognition that would lead to that portfolio moving to lifetime ECL measurement when credit risk increases beyond that maximum level. This simplification is only relevant when exposures are segmented on a sufficiently granular basis such that a credit institution can demonstrate that the analysis is consistent with the principles of IFRS 9. Specifically, credit institutions should be able to demonstrate that a

PARAGRAPH_82254: 123. IFRS 9, in paragraphs 5.5.12 and B5.5.25-B5.5.27, sets out the requirements for the assessment of significant increases in credit risk for lending exposures whose contractual cash flows have been renegotiated or modified. In particular, for modifications that do not result in derecognition in accordance with IFRS 9, an entity must assess whether credit risk has increased significantly by comparing (a) the risk of a default occurring at the reporting date based on the modified contractual terms with (b) the risk of default occurring upon initial recognition based on the original, unmodified contractual terms.

PARAGRAPH_82255: 124.

Consideration should also be given to the substance of modified contractual cash flows as well as the implications of the modifications for the future credit risk of the lending exposure (taking into consideration the obligor's credit risk). Factors to consider include, but are not limited to, the following:

PARAGRAPH_82264: 126. Lending exposures transferred to lifetime ECL that are subsequently renegotiated or modified, and not derecognised, should not move back to 12-month ECL measurement unless there is sufficient evidence that the credit risk over the life of the exposure has not increased significantly compared with that upon initial recognition. For example, where a credit institution grants various concessions such as interest rate reductions or postponements of principal repayments to obligors in financial difficulty, the lending exposure may exhibit characteristics of a lower credit risk even though in reality the obligor may continue to experience financial difficulty with no realistic prospects of making scheduled repayments over the remaining term of the exposure. In accordance with paragraph B5.5.27 of IFRS 9 'evidence that the criteria for the recognition of lifetime ECL are no longer met could include a history of up-to-date and timely payment performance against the modified contractual terms. Typically, a customer would need to demonstrate consistently good payment behaviour over a period of time before the credit risk is considered to have decreased. For example, a history of missed or incomplete payments would not typically be erased by simply making one payment on time following a modification of the contractual terms'.

PARAGRAPH_82268: 129. Credit institutions should make limited use of those practical expedients as they have the potential to introduce significant bias and because - given their business - the cost of obtaining the relevant information is not likely to involve 'undue cost or effort'. Credit institutions should consider the need to make adjustments when using practical expedients to avoid any resulting bias, as they should take into account that the objective of IFRS 9 is to estimate expected credit losses to reflect an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes (IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.17).

Nevertheless, additional cost and operational burden do not need to be introduced where they do not contribute to a high- quality implementation of IFRS 9.

In accordance with paragraph 5.5.10 of IFRS 9, 'an entity may assume that the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial instrument is determined to have a low credit risk at the reporting date'. Although credit institutions thus have the option for 'low credit risk' exposures not to assess whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, use of this exemption should be limited. In particular, credit institutions should conduct timely assessment of significant increases in credit risk for all lending exposures.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:47] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82277: 133. In that context, credit institutions should always recognise changes in 12-month ECL through the allowance where there is not a significant increase in credit risk and move lending exposures to lifetime ECL measurement, if there is a significant increase in credit risk. In order to achieve a high-quality implementation of IFRS 9, any use of the low-credit-risk exemption should be accompanied by clear evidence that credit risk as of the reporting date is sufficiently low that a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition could not have occurred.

To illustrate the meaning of low credit risk in IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.22, IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.23, cites as an example an instrument with an external 'investment grade' rating. However, all lending exposures that have an 'investment grade' rating from a credit rating agency cannot automatically be considered low credit risk. Credit institutions should rely primarily on their own credit risk assessments in order to evaluate the credit risk of a lending exposure, and not rely solely or mechanistically on ratings provided by credit rating agencies (where the latter are available). Nevertheless, optimistic internal credit ratings, as compared with external ratings, should require additional analysis and justification by a credit institution's management body or senior management.

Moreover, credit institutions should take into account that significant reliance on backward-looking information will introduce bias into the implementation of an ECL accounting model and that they should ensure that the objectives of the IFRS 9 impairment requirements (i.e. to reflect ECL that meet the stated measurement objectives and to capture all significant increases in credit risk) are met.

PARAGRAPH_82298: c. the credit institution's processes reflect the risk appetite of the credit institution in a manner that ensures lending exposures on which credit risk has increased since origination or purchase to a level in excess of the credit institution's risk appetite are promptly identified and properly monitored, and ECL allowance estimates appropriately reflect the increases in the credit risk of these exposures as increases are identified. Where a credit institution originates or purchases a lending exposure on which credit risk at acquisition exceeds the institution's risk appetite and which therefore represents an exception to the institution's lending policies and standards, competent authorities should evaluate whether the institution has established and adheres to appropriate processes and controls for: the initial identification, review, approval and documentation of such exposures; the reporting of such policy exceptions to senior management and, for individually significant exposures, to the management body; and the proper monitoring of such exposures after initial recognition. Competent authorities should also evaluate whether the credit institution's processes and controls separately identify ECL allowance estimates related to exposures consistent with the credit institution's risk appetite and those related to riskier lending exposures;

PARAGRAPH_82321: 144. In assessing the appropriateness of the level of allowances for lending exposures as an element of a credit institution's overall capital adequacy, competent authorities should look at their credit risk practices and take into account that the credit institution's related ECL processes, methodology and underlying assumptions require the exercise of a substantial degree of experienced credit judgement.

PARAGRAPH_82342: High-quality and consistent application of accounting standards are the basis for the effective and consistent application of regulatory capital requirements.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:53] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82343: Accounting frameworks are commonly principles-based and credit institutions should use judgement when applying the accounting standards, with the objective of providing useful financial information to the users. In this regard, the use of judgement plays a fundamental role in some areas of accounting. For this reason, it is important for competent authorities to promote a high-quality and consistent application of the accounting standards which would also help in the comparability of financial statements across institutions. In addition, it would be a concern for competent authorities if, as a result of a low-quality implementation of the accounting standards, credit institutions have inadequate levels of ECL allowances relative to the credit risk of the loan portfolios, for instance if credit institutions minimise the effort to consider forward-looking information, which is a central feature of an expected credit loss ('ECL') model.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:53]
PARAGRAPH_82344: In addition, a significant number of credit institutions apply the IFRS Standards as these are incorporated into the EU legal framework through EU regulations, in accordance with the procedures set out in Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002. IFRS 9, which will replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for the accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 201834, requires among other things measurement of impairment loss provisions based on an ECL accounting model rather than on an incurred loss accounting model.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:53]
PARAGRAPH_82345: The application of IFRS 9 also requires the use of judgement in the ECL assessment and measurement process, which could potentially affect the consistent application of IFRS 9 across institutions and the comparability of credit institutions' financial statements. Therefore, the existence of supervisory guidance emphasises the importance of high-quality, robust and consistent application of IFRS 9 and could help promote consistent interpretations and practices.

PARAGRAPH_82351: In addition, at an international level, in December 2015, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ('BCBS') issued supervisory guidance on credit risk and accounting for expected credit losses (the 'BCBS guidance'), which sets out supervisory expectations for credit institutions related to sound credit risk practices associated with implementing and applying an ECL accounting model and specific guidance for credit institutions applying IFRS Standards.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:56] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82386: Costs: In the absence of the proposed regulatory intervention (option 1.1), increased use of judgement in the application of principles-based accounting requirements related to credit risk under IFRS 9 would be a source of prudential concern. This could result in a low-quality and inconsistent implementation of IFRS 9, and therefore in inadequate levels of ECL allowances relative to the credit risk of the loan portfolios - for instance if credit institutions minimise the effort to consider forward-looking information, which is a central feature of an expected credit loss model. This can have an adverse effect on the comparability of financial statements and the capital adequacy of credit institutions. These adverse effects would be amplified by the unlevel- playing field that will exist across credit institutions at an international level, when the BCBS guidance is applied at an international level, but no equivalent regulation has been developed in the EU. Therefore, the policy objectives of these guidelines would not be met.

PARAGRAPH_82400: Of the total number of credit institutions in the EU, 156 credit institutions submit supervisory data under IFRS Standards on a consolidated basis43. Although this number is low compared with the total number of credit institutions in the EU (only 3%), these credit institutions on aggregate represent EUR 32.5 trillion or 75% of the total assets of all credit institutions in the EU as of 31 December 2014, representing on average 64% of total assets and ranging between 27% and 100% of 'total assets' across Member States. In addition, loans and advances of these credit institutions represent 53% of the total assets for the sample of 156 credit institutions, being on average 61% of 'total assets' and ranging between 27% and 81% of total assets across Member States. Therefore, IFRS Standards are applied in a significant part of the total number of credit institutions in the EU, covering the majority of the total assets of all credit institutions. For these credit institutions, loans and advances are a significant component - if not the most significant in some cases - of their total assets.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:57]
PARAGRAPH_82401: In addition, according to Regulation (EC) No 1606/200244, Member States may require or permit the application of IFRS Standards to the consolidated financial statements of entities whose securities do not trade in a regulated securities market or to the annual financial statements (traded on regulated markets or otherwise). In particular, as indicated by the latest stock-take of the Commission in December 2013 on the use of the options provided in Regulation (EC) No 1606/200245, in some Member States, IFRS Standards are mandatorily applied for all or some types of entities in their consolidated financial statements (16 Member States) and individual financial statements (13 Member States). In the majority of Member States (all but six Member States), entities may apply IFRS Standards on a voluntary basis. In many cases where IFRS Standards are required, credit institutions are among the types of entities to which IFRS mandatorily apply. Therefore, across Member States, more credit institutions than those applying IFRS Standards for supervisory reporting46 apply IFRS, and these guidelines are also relevant to these credit institutions. In addition, in some Member States' credit institutions may apply IFRS Standards only for supervisory reporting (financial statements will be prepared under national GAAP).

PARAGRAPH_82402: In conclusion, the subject matter (loans and advances) and the scope of application of these guidelines (more than 75% of the total assets of the EU banking sector) indicate that these guidelines are relevant to a significant part of the EU banking sector, and the issuance of EBA own initiative guidelines in order to meet the objectives of the guidelines noted above is considered to be of high importance.

PARAGRAPH_82775: Benefits: The criteria to be used to decide how to apply the proportionality approach are consistent with the criteria set out in the BCBS guidance. In addition, this option requires compliance in outcome, which is the application of sound credit risk and accounting practices by all credit institutions, providing freedom of means for achieving that according to the assessment of specific proportionality criteria. Therefore, any additional incremental costs of applying these guidelines would be reduced to the maximum extent possible, since the application of the guidelines would be tailored to the specificities of a credit institution.

PARAGRAPH_82794: Of most importance, the application of criteria for the identification of systemically important credit institutions or other credit institutions may increase the risk of introducing thresholds to be mechanically applied in identifying these institutions, without a thorough assessment of whether the guidelines should be applied or not. Furthermore, limiting the use of practical expedients of IFRS 9 only to systemically important credit institutions or other credit institutions through these guidelines may be perceived as encouraging the use of practical expedients in general when it could be avoided, which would also be inconsistent with the objectives of IFRS 9, these guidelines and the BCBS guidance.

PARAGRAPH_82795: Preferred option: The costs of including a proportionality approach which exempts some credit institutions from applying the requirements of the guidelines (options 2.2 and 2.3) would be disproportionate to the benefits of additional convergence of practices across the EU. A mix of options 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 which, while proposing the application of the general proportionality approach, also includes criteria for the application of the proportionality approach but without introducing a mechanistic approach or creating additional complexity, introduces a more proportional approach in the application of the guidelines. This is expected to create net benefits in the functioning of the internal market and the establishment of a level playing field internationally, and is thus the preferred option 48.

PARAGRAPH_82798: Costs: Requiring that these guidelines be applied by all institutions (option 3.1) would pose unnecessary cost and burden for some institutions which are not active in the lending business and, in particular, the investment firms. The business of lending is less relevant to investment firms and therefore the requirements of these guidelines on credit risk and accounting for expected credit losses would not be as relevant to them. Hence the costs of requiring compliance with these guidelines would outweigh the related benefits from applying these guidelines.

PARAGRAPH_82826: Proportionality

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:65]
PARAGRAPH_82827: Some respondents believe that the guidelines should develop further the requirements for the application of the principle of proportionality and provide more guidance on this aspect, but they believe also that the guidelines are too prescriptive regarding the use of practical expedients (to allow these to be applied only in the case of smaller and less complex credit institutions). The majority of the respondents who answered the question on the impact assessment expressed a preference for the application of the guidelines in a proportionate manner without defining more specific criteria (option 2.1).

PARAGRAPH_82834: Some respondents considered the guidelines too restrictive on the use of practical expedients. In particular they highlight that practical expedients are restricted to 'smaller and less complex credit institutions', while the general provisions on proportionality extend its application to a broader scope of credit institutions (including smaller and less complex ones), taking into account 'all relevant facts and circumstances'. Therefore, they suggest that the proportionality principle should be applied consistently throughout the guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:67]
PARAGRAPH_82847: Several respondents mentioned that the guidelines are overly prescriptive and suggested following a more principles-based approach. For instance, several respondents referred to the use of the word 'should' in the EBA guidelines, which may create expectations that go beyond the BCBS guidance, and other respondents indicated that paragraphs 33, 36, 37 and 40 impose strict requirements and could be seen as a checklist (for example the use of the word 'in particular').

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:67] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_82848: As the addressees of any EBA guidelines should make every effort to comply with the guidelines (see Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/201016 50), guidelines need to be written in a manner that accommodates this objective; hence the use of specific legal terminology in the guidelines (for example the use of the word 'should'). However, it should be stressed that these guidelines should be read not as a checklist but holistically, as explained in paragraph 12 in the Background section of the guidelines. Whenever lists are provided they are not intended to be all-inclusive.

In addition, the same respondent mentioned that for credit institutions the guidelines will restrict the choices available in IFRS 9 and that the guidelines should contain a statement clarifying that, should there be any conflicts between the guidelines and the IFRS 9/IFRIC statements related to IFRS 9, the latter should prevail. One respondent suggested highlighting all areas in which the EBA guidelines are intended to be different from the BCBS guidance, together with relevant explanations.

The Commission responded on 29 March 2017 to the European Parliament resolution acknowledging the work of the EBA on this area. Therefore, it is not the objective of these guidelines to contradict the accounting requirements of IFRS 9, although they may have the effect of restricting the flexibility that IFRS 9 allows. In instances when definitions have been included in the guidelines, that is to facilitate the application of the guidelines, without duplicating existing definitions in IFRS 9 or the relevant regulatory framework as explained in paragraph 15 of the main text of the guidelines. The objective of the EBA guidelines is to be in line with the BCBS guidance so that compliance with the EBA guidelines would also result in compliance with the BCBS guidance.

PARAGRAPH_82885: Question 1 (Scope)

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:70]
PARAGRAPH_82886: The vast majority of respondents stated that the scope of application of the guidelines is appropriate and sufficiently clear. A few respondents did not agree with the scope of application, mentioning the need to clarify: - the scope of application in the case of a non-EU subsidiary of an EU bank, as it should not be subject to the EBA guidelines; - whether the scope of application is limited to loans, loan commitments and financial guarantees (as in the BCBS guidance), or it covers all financial instruments within the scope of impairment requirements of IFRS 9; - the approach for debt securities at amortised cost or fair value through Other Comprehensive Income, as these exclusions could lead to a non- homogeneous quality of risk management practices promoted by the EBA.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:70]
PARAGRAPH_82887: The EBA believes that the text of the guidelines is sufficiently clear on the scope of application of the guidelines. Paragraph 11 of the guidelines includes the scope of application, which includes credit institutions on an individual, sub-consolidated and consolidated basis in accordance with Article 109 of Directive 2013/36/EU. Paragraphs 9 and 10 further define the scope of application of these guidelines. Paragraph 7 also mentions that the EBA guidelines should be applied to lending exposures, and lending exposures are defined further in paragraph 15 of the guidelines, which includes definitions. This is consistent with the relevant BCBS guidance. The EBA does not consider that there is a sufficiently strong case to develop material that would apply to instruments beyond the scope of the BCBS guidance, i.e. debt securities.

PARAGRAPH_82896: Among them, a few respondents specified that the guidelines should state that application is required from the first financial period beginning on or after 1 January 2018, as per IFRS 9, rather than from 1 January 2018. One respondent preferred that the application of the guidelines be postponed to 1 January 2020 in order to enable banks to test and improve their own systems during 2018 (best practice is expected to emerge after 2018), considering that the guidelines introduce additional requirements to IFRS 9, especially in relation to sound credit risk management practices. Alternatively, they proposed some transitional or grandfathering rules as explained in Question 3.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:71] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82897: effective date of IFRS 9. However, some changes have been introduced to the guidelines to clarify the application date. The application date of the guidelines is the start of the first accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2018. This is consistent with the effective application date of IFRS 9. The EBA also understands that implementation efforts are ongoing (development of processes, systems, models and data) and are expected to be constantly evolving until the initial application of IFRS 9. Therefore, credit institutions may decide to consider the content of this guidelines before the initial application of IFRS 9. Regarding the postponement of the application of the guidelines, the EBA believes that it would not encourage the application of sound credit risk management practices from the initial application of IFRS 9 - which would have been earlier than the application of the guidelines, as proposed by the respondent. On the comment regarding the different application date for systemic institutions, please refer to the application of the proportionality principle in Question 3 below.

PARAGRAPH_82908: The EBA understands that there is an interaction between these guidelines and other regulatory products. For instance, during the consultation on the Guidelines on the definition of default there were different views on whether the implementation date should be the same or the EBA guidelines on default should be implemented after the implementation of IFRS 9. In this regard, the changes in the guidelines on default have to be implemented at the latest by the end of 2020, hence sufficient time is granted after the date of implementation of IFRS 9. However, credit institutions may implement the changes in a shorter timeframe. Therefore, if it is deemed appropriate, credit institutions may align the timeline for implementation of the abovementioned regulatory products.

In addition, a few respondents argued that, in some areas, the guidelines are written as rule- based guidance with strict requirements that are difficult to align with the principles of proportionality and materiality. One respondent mentioned that while the application of the EBA guidelines by credit institutions is to be according to the 'nature, scope and complexity of their activities', it (i.e. the respondent) nevertheless sees a need for a much clearer statement in the body of the guidelines that indicates that the EBA fully appreciates that differing firms will have significantly different approaches in their application of IFRS 9.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:73]
PARAGRAPH_82921: example, different techniques or models may be used in the measurement of ECL. It is also the case that increasing the complexity of the methods used or the amount of data does not always improve the measurement of ECL (for instance the addition of more scenarios when a representative sample of possible outcomes has been considered). Therefore, these guidelines should be applied in a proportionate manner, considering also the principle of materiality. Both are mentioned in paragraphs 17- 18 of the main text of the guidelines, which do not rule out the application of the proportionality and materiality principle for credit institutions which are less complex or smaller. Therefore, the EBA believes that the requirements in the guidelines related to the proportionality and materiality considerations strike the appropriate balance in providing, as far as possible, sufficiently specific guidance to ensure robust and consistent application of IFRS 9 and at the same time avoiding the introduction of 'bright lines' or a rules-based approach, which could lead to a mechanical application of the guidelines.

In this regard, one respondent mentioned that proportionality should not only be limited to less complex banks, as smaller subsidiaries or branches of large credit institutions should also benefit from applying the proportionality principles. - In addition, one respondent suggested considering the Global Public Policy Committee (GPPC) guidelines when developing further the concept of proportionality. - One respondent mentioned that, in the case of individual portfolios, materiality, risk and data availability should be considered in applying the principle of proportionality. - A few respondents mentioned that 'less developed markets' should also be one of the criteria for the application of proportionality.

PARAGRAPH_82932: Question 1 above. In this regard proportionality should be applied at each level (individual, sub- consolidated and consolidated basis). The EBA also recognises that the appropriate approach to proportionality needs to consider entity factors (including - among others - size, business model, complexity, cross-border activity or the existing use of the SA or the IRB approach) as well as portfolio factors (including - among others - complexity, materiality and available data). The EBA guidelines do not refer explicitly to 'less developed markets'. However, as explained above, different entity and portfolio factors need to be considered and therefore the EBA understands that there may be differences in the availability of information between different markets; credit institutions will need to consider this issue when applying the guidelines in a proportionate manner.

PARAGRAPH_82954: Proportionality and practical expedients - A few respondents were concerned that the scope of application of the proposed guidelines is wider than the scope of the BCBS guidelines. This is particularly important for practical expedients as the limitations on their use would apply to all banks in the EU applying IFRS 9 and this limitation goes beyond the BCBS guidance. - A few respondents mentioned that the guidelines include different proportionality principles in paragraph 17 and in paragraph 129 (practical expedients), which refers only to 'smaller and less complex credit institutions' (i.e. paragraph 129). As a conclusion, they consider paragraph 129 too restrictive. - A few respondents suggested introducing more detailed definitions of 'small' and 'less complex' institutions, one respondent suggested referring to 'credit institutions which are both smaller or less complex' and another suggested that, instead of smaller and less complex institutions, paragraph 129 should refer to the complexity of the portfolios. - One respondent mentioned that the

PARAGRAPH_82955: On the use of practical expedients, the guidelines should be applied in a proportionate manner in accordance with paragraph 17 and 18, which are relevant throughout the guidelines. The reference to smaller and less complex credit institutions for the use of practical expedients in paragraph 129 aimed at providing more guidance to credit institutions on the application of the proportionality approach in that context. However, in the light of consultation responses, the EBA believes that defining further smaller and less complex credit institutions could add more complexity in the guidelines. Therefore, this reference has been removed from the text.

In addition, a few respondents mentioned that the use of practical expedients should be allowed for exposures that are originated before the first application of IFRS 9, if the actual data are not available and cannot be generated without undue cost or effort. - One respondent mentioned that, for smaller and less complex banks, it would be difficult to assess whether there is bias when applying practical expedients without investing in complex processes. For this reason, these banks should be exempted from complying with paragraphs 19, 122 and 138 of the draft guidelines, or provided with more guidance. One respondent was also

PARAGRAPH_82965: As explained above, the EBA guidelines should be applied in a proportionate manner which should consider, among other factors, the complexity of the credit institution. The EBA guidelines do not cover all the practical expedients that institutions may use under IFRS 9 but refer specifically only to the information set, the low credit risk exemption and the 30-days-past-due rebuttable presumption. The principles of proportionality and materiality as explained above should also be applied on the initial application of the guidelines and in accordance with chapter 7.2. of IFRS 9. The reference to bias has been kept in the text, as, irrespective of the size or complexity of the bank, bias should not be introduced to meet the objectives of IFRS 9. However, the EBA understands that there could be different approaches in the ECL measurement and therefore that the use of the word 'ideal' in paragraph 19 of the draft Guidelines may create ambiguity.

PARAGRAPH_82974: concerned about the reference to 'ideal' measures in paragraph 19, as there may be no common, generally accepted view on this (a variety of approaches may be applied). - A few respondents consider the approach on practical expedients very restrictive, since they do not agree with the conclusion that limited use needs to be made of practical expedients in order to achieve robust and consistent implementation of IFRS 9. - A few respondents mentioned that a reasonable use of the 30-days-past-due rebuttable presumption would not be inconsistent with a high-quality implementation and should be subject to the principles of proportionality and materiality with regard to the size and inherent risks of such exposures. For example, one respondent referred to some retail portfolios where the 30-days- past-due indicator would better reflect consumer behaviour and where macroeconomic factors and forward- looking information would not necessarily be relevant.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:78] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_82975: As explained in the guidelines, credit institutions should make limited use of practical expedients. However, this is also subject to the principles of proportionality and materiality. For instance, the use of the 30-days-past-due rebuttable presumption would need to be assessed against the criteria to apply a proportionate approach considering the specificities of the exposure (and the portfolio in which the exposure may be grouped) and the credit institutions as included in the main text of the guidelines. The EBA also recalls that all credit institutions applying IFRS 9 should ensure that they meet the objectives of IFRS 9 when applying the standard, so as to estimate expected credit losses which reflect an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes (IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.17). Therefore, the use of practical expedients is expected to be limited, as practical expedients have the potential to introduce bias in ECL measurement.

PARAGRAPH_82984: of the
The following paragraphs include in detail the main paragraphs of the guidelines that were mentioned by respondents in their responses to the public consultation and with which they disagree or that would require additional clarifications: - Paragraph 23 of the draft guidelines requires banks to provide clearly documented and robust justification where, in exceptional circumstances, information relevant to the assessment of credit risk is not deemed reasonable and supportable. One respondent indicated that this requirement overrides IFRS 9 and should be deleted. A few other respondents believe that this wording or its interpretation could be read as requiring justification for not including every possible future scenario, and therefore that the wording needs also to be amended to clarify that this is not the case. One respondent suggested that this paragraph could rather ask credit institutions to justify the scenarios that have been retained. In addition, a few respondents considered that paragraph 38 of the draft guidelines (regarding the consideration of different potential scenarios) will be an additional requirement beyond IFRS 9 and should be subject to cost-benefit considerations,

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:79] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_82985: Paragraph 23 of the guidelines is consistent with the requirements in BCBS guidance and it is explained that the cases when information relevant to the assessment and measurement of credit risk is not reasonable and supportable would be exceptional. It requires documentation in circumstances in which information is relevant to the assessment and measurement of credit risk but which is not reasonable and supportable, so the focus is likely to be on the bounds of what is reasonable and supportable. In addition, with regard to the comment on the justification for not including every possible scenario, paragraph 39 of the guidelines explicitly mentions that a credit institution does not need to identify or model every possible scenario through scenario simulations but should consider all reasonable and supportable information. Therefore, the EBA believes that, for these exceptional cases, the guidelines are sufficiently balanced by requiring justification without imposing significant additional burden. Similarly, paragraph 38 is consistent with the BCBS guidance and it requires that credit institutions develop and document their processes to generate relevant scenarios in line with sound credit risk methodologies. The EBA believes that the

A few respondents recommended clarifying that the independence of model validation from model development can also be achieved if the validation and development of the model in question is performed in the same organisational unit by different persons, and if the validation results are approved by a committee that ensures independent decisions on the conclusions to be drawn from the validation results, such as the need for new model development or a recalibration.

Therefore, the EBA believes that these requirements do not impose unnecessary restrictions on credit institutions, as they are consistent with the relevant existing requirements for model validation in the regulatory framework and the BCBS guidance. As mentioned in the EBA Report on the first impact assessment of IFRS 992, the EBA acknowledges that the possible synergies and also the impact of IFRS 9 on the IRB regulatory capital models should be considered. Banks can benefit from alignment of their prudential and accounting models, if the prudential models are fit for IFRS 9 purposes with appropriate modification to meet IFRS 9 requirements. This will allow the use of infrastructure already developed by the bank (such as methodologies, data and models) and allow for greater consistency within a bank (for example in terms of the governance arrangements used). On the independence of model development and validation (paragraph 67 of the guidelines), the EBA believes that the current text of the guidelines is sufficiently clear and consistent with the relevant requirements on the independence of model development and model validation included in the CRR; furthermore, it does not limit a credit

Another respondent suggested that disclosure requirements be left to accounting and supervisory frameworks and that, if disclosures in addition to those required by IFRS 7 are introduced, the reason for that should be explained. One respondent mentioned that it would be better if the guidelines included only high-level disclosure principles and a request to comply with all relevant accounting rules and regulatory requirements, or a clear statement that they do not request disclosure beyond the requirements in the applicable accounting and regulatory rules. However, another respondent suggested that the guidelines should ensure industry-consistent disclosures on asset quality in each of the

Regarding the consistency with the disclosure requirements under IFRS 7, the EBA believes that these guidelines are consistent with IFRS and that a high-quality implementation of IFRS 9 should enable credit institutions to provide high-quality disclosures.

This is not consistent with IFRS 9 B5.5.15. The factors listed in this paragraph of the guidelines should not lead to an automatic move to lifetime expected loss, in part because they might act as false indicators to banks.

Risk- adjusted pricing is mentioned as an indicator of significant increase of credit risk but is not mandated such that risk-adjusted pricing should be used in all occasions mechanically as the only indicator of significant increase of credit risk. In addition, paragraph 107(a) does not refer to all factors that may have an impact on the pricing of the loan but specifically refers to the element of the price of the lending exposure that reflects the credit risk of the exposure.

PARAGRAPH_83046: - Paragraph 120: a few respondents mentioned that it should be stated in the guidelines that a comparison of past lifetime PD estimates at initial recognition with the lifetime PDs estimated on the reporting date can make sense only if the comparison is made for congruent periods of time (as implied in IFRS 9 B5.5.11). - Paragraph 124: a few respondents indicated that the sentence 'credit institutions should ensure that modifications or renegotiations do not obscure increases in credit risk ... ' relates to IFRS 9 preventing preparers from hiding credit deteriorations by modifications or renegotiations of the contractual terms and conditions. This

PARAGRAPH_83047: The EBA acknowledges that the comparison of past lifetime PD estimates should consider the factors explained in IFRS 9 B5.5.11. However, the purpose of paragraph 120 is to explain the difference between the general principle of IFRS 9 (relative model) and the example where an institution has set a maximum level of credit risk. Having said that, the guidelines do not aim to prescribe in further detail the methodology for this aspect of assessing a significant increase of credit risk.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:85] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_83049: Regarding paragraph 124, as the focus of this paragraph (renegotiations/modifications that could lead to obscuring increase of credit risk) is different from the one in IFRS 9 paragraph B5.5.5 (grouping of exposures with shared credit risk characteristics), a direct reference to IFRS 9 seems less relevant.

PARAGRAPH_83058: - One respondent noted that paragraph 130 imposes an additional burden of proof on the bank. - Paragraph 133: a few respondents mentioned that the use of the low credit risk exemption was justified and that it was unclear how credit institutions can demonstrate that the low credit risk exemption was not used for the purpose of omitting timely assessment and tracking of credit risk, and that the risk of the relevant loan was 'sufficiently low'.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:86]
PARAGRAPH_83059: On the use of justifications for the use of practical expedients, the EBA believes that the guidelines are not unduly prescriptive on this aspect. Given that advancing credit is a core business of credit institutions, it is appropriate that banks should document justifications for the use of practical expedients.

PARAGRAPH_83060: On the use of the low credit risk exemption, the EBA guidelines aim to enhance timely assessment and tracking of significant increase of credit risk, including also cases of exposures with low credit risk. The EBA guidelines aim to ensure that the credit risk of these exposures is monitored adequately and that any increases in the ECL are recognised on a timely basis. Therefore, sound credit risk management should also be applied in the cases of low credit risk exposures, and this should allow a credit institution to demonstrate the appropriateness of the use of this exemption.

PARAGRAPH_83075: One respondent disagreed with the baseline assertion regarding the existence of an unlevel- playing field across credit institutions at an international level, to the extent that other jurisdictions across the world apply the BCBS guidance only to internationally active banks. In addition, one respondent disagreed with the concluding assertion that the guidelines would ensure a level playing field at international level, since convergence with US GAAP has not been achieved. One respondent mentioned that, while the benefits of the proposed guidelines are particularly clear for large credit institutions, for smaller credit institutions or immaterial subsidiaries/branches/portfolios it would be helpful to have further clarification of how the implementation benefits outweigh the costs.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:87]
PARAGRAPH_83076: Regarding the comments on the level playing field, the EBA acknowledges that the BCBS guidance is more relevant to internationally active banks and that IFRS and US GAAP requirements on ECL are not fully converged. However, as in the BCBS guidance, sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.4 apply to all credit institutions applying an expected credit loss accounting framework, while section 4.3 is relevant to credit institutions applying IFRS 9. Therefore, these guidelines should provide to some extent a level playing field across those credit institutions applying an expected credit loss accounting framework (such as IFRS or US GAAP) and also across jurisdictions that apply either the EBA guidelines or the BCBS guidance.
