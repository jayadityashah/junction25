PARAGRAPH_105331: 1. Executive summary

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_105332: These guidelines (GL) specify how loss given default (LGD) appropriate for an economic downturn, which has been identified in accordance with the final draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on economic downturn, should be quantified. They supplement the Guidelines on PD estimation, LGD estimation and the treatment of defaulted assets (EBA/GL/2017/16)1 of 20/11/2017 (GL on PD and LGD estimation) and provide specific guidance on how to estimate LGD appropriate for an economic downturn.

PARAGRAPH_105333: These GL are hence an addendum to the GL on PD and LGD estimation, which are part of the European Banking Authority's (EBA's) roadmap to reduce unwarranted variability of risk parameters and own funds requirements. As such, this publication completes the plan outlined in the report on the review of the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) approach published in February 2016.2,3 The policy for downturn LGD estimation builds on the notion of an economic downturn that is specified in the final draft regulatory technical standards on the specification of the nature, severity and duration of an economic downturn in accordance with Articles 181(3)(a) and 182(4)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), published on 16 November 2018.4

PARAGRAPH_105334: The RTS on economic downturn set out the requirements for the identification of an economic downturn for the type of exposures covered by a rating system. As a rating system may, however, cover exposures from different businesses, sectors and geographical areas, the notion of an economic downturn set forth in the RTS may comprise several distinct downturn periods. The GL for downturn LGD estimation provide guidance on how to calibrate downturn LGD appropriate for an economic downturn, taking into account the downturn period(s) identified in accordance with the RTS. To this end, the GL differentiate three types of approaches for calibrating downturn LGD:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_105335: (i) type 1 approaches, based on the observed impact on losses of a particular downturn period;

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_105336: (ii) type 2 approaches, where such an impact on losses has not been observed (e.g. because the downturn periods identified in accordance with the RTS have occurred too long ago) but the impact can be estimated using a limited set of methodologies;

PARAGRAPH_105339: 3 It should be noted that the work on the RTS on economic downturn (which was a single item in that plan) has been split into the specification of the notion of an economic downturn and these GL providing guidance on how to incorporate such a downturn into LGD estimates.

PARAGRAPH_105343: (iii) type 3 approaches, where neither type 1 nor type 2 approaches can be applied and therefore institutions may apply their preferred modelling approach but have to comply with a minimum margin of conservatism (MoC) requirement.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_105344: Although the downturn LGD estimates should optimally be quantified based on the observed loss data, this approach is permitted only where relevant and sufficient loss data to analyse the observed impact of the downturn period under consideration are available. If this is the case, downturn LGDs should be quantified based on observed data reflecting the impact of the downturn period under consideration. However, if no loss data are available to calibrate downturn LGD for a particular downturn period based on observed data, it may be possible to estimate the impact on the losses of this downturn period. Therefore, in the latter case institutions are required to calibrate downturn LGD through more prescriptive approaches. Two methodologies are allowed in this case, namely the extrapolation and haircut approaches (or a combination of the two). Under both methodologies and in line with paragraphs 37, 42 and 43 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation, an appropriate MoC to cover for the lack of data (Category A MoC) will in addition be required. Finally, a third approach is available in cases where no relevant loss data are available for the downturn periods under consideration and institutions can justify to the satisfaction of the competent authorities that they cannot apply the extrapolation and/or haircut approach or a combination of the two. In this case, institutions may apply their preferred modelling approach, but have to add MoC to cover for the methodological and data deficiencies, such that the downturn LGD estimates including MoC are equal or higher than the long-run average LGD plus 15 percentage points, capped at 105%.

PARAGRAPH_105345: Last, a reference value is introduced that acts as a non-binding challenger to the final downturn LGD estimation and as a guide for the supervisory assessment of the appropriateness of the resulting quantification. This means that the reference value acts as a challenger to the whole downturn LGD estimation, including the proper identification of the downturn period(s) pursuant to the RTS on economic downturn.

PARAGRAPH_105346: These GL provide requirements for the calibration of downturn LGD. Given this, they provide for a different calibration target next to the long-run average. Therefore, these GL do not touch upon issues related to model development.

PARAGRAPH_105347: The guidelines will support the appropriate quantification of downturn LGD. Like the GL on PD and LGD estimation, it is expected that these GL will lead to material model changes for a significant number of rating systems. In this context, it should be recalled that these GL are an addendum to the GL on PD and LGD estimation and that therefore the proposed phasing-in approach, as well as the deadline of at latest end-2020 for the final implementation, set out in the EBA's Opinion on the implementation of the review of the IRB approach,5 published by EBA in February 2016, will apply.

PARAGRAPH_105353: 2.1 Introduction

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_105354: 1. The quantification of downturn LGD has been challenging for competent authorities, industry and academics alike ever since the Basel II framework introduced this concept. The requirement for loss given default (LGD) and conversion factor (CF) estimates to reflect economic downturn conditions was introduced in the Basel II capital framework and stems from the general economic model that is used to derive the formula for calculating minimum own funds requirements. In the Basel II capital framework, unexpected losses are based on the conditional expected loss given a high confidence level for the single systematic risk factor leading to high credit losses. Whereas the risk weight formula includes a supervisory mapping function to derive conditional probabilities of default (PDs)6 from unconditional long-run average PDs estimated by the institutions, it does not provide an explicit function that would transform long-run average LGDs and exposures at default (EADs) into conditional LGDs and exposure values (respectively CFs). Instead, it requires institutions to use LGDs that are appropriate for an economic downturn. The lack of explicit guidance and limited supervisory and industry consensus on how to incorporate the economic downturn component in model estimation has led to significant differences in practices and has given rise to unwarranted variability in risk-weighted exposure (RWE) amounts when own estimates of LGDs and/or CFs are used.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_105355: 2. These guidelines (GL) understand downturn LGD estimation as an aspect of risk parameter quantification - in line with the specification of the respective requirements in Sub-Section 2, Section 6, Chapter 3 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR). This implies, most importantly, that the quantification of downturn LGD should refer to the same LGD model used for the assignment of facilities to facility grades or pools that is relevant to the long-run average LGD estimation. Thus, it is expected that the assignment to facility grades and pools within a given calibration segment should not change due to downturn LGD estimation. These GL do not apply to CF estimation appropriate for an economic downturn.

PARAGRAPH_105356: Context of downturn LGD estimation

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_105357: 3. In general terms, the European Banking Authority (EBA) is fully supportive of allowing a diversity of model practices. The strength of internal models lies in the ability of institutions to model on institution-specific data, which ensures a high degree of risk sensitivity and constitutes an important characteristic of own funds requirements that should be maintained. It is, however, also clear that this requires sufficiently granular data and specific guidance on the calibration targets. In this context, these guidelines focus on the calibration target, i.e. LGDs appropriate for an economic downturn (downturn LGDs), and not the calibration

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_105363: 4. Because of this understanding, the level at which downturn LGDs are calibrated should be at least the same as the level at which long-run average LGDs are calculated for the purpose of calibration. In this context, it should be recalled that the GL on PD and LGD estimation define the notion of 'calibration segments' as a uniquely identified subset of the range of application of the LGD model that is jointly calibrated. The use of calibration segments does not, however, require institutions to calibrate LGDs at the level of calibration segments. Institutions may use calibration segments but calibrate LGD estimates at the level of each grade or pool (e.g. if, in the step of calibration, the portfolio under consideration is split by certain regions) within those calibration segments. However, regardless of whether an institution calculates the long- run average LGD at the level of calibration segments or at the level of grades or pools, both with the objective of providing LGD estimates by facility grade or pool, the quantification of downturn LGD estimates should follow the level considered by the institution for the purpose of calibrating LGD estimates to the long-run average LGD.

PARAGRAPH_105364: 5. In line with the aspects covered by the CRR in the context of quantification of risk parameters, these GL provide, in addition, requirements on MoC related to downturn LGD estimation. Issues of representativeness have not been addressed, as these are covered by subsection 4.2.4 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation. Figure 1 illustrates (analogously to Figure 3 of the Background and rationale section of the GL on PD and LGD estimation) how the GL on downturn LGD estimation are embedded in the GL on PD and LGD estimation.

PARAGRAPH_105403: 6. The CRR sets out requirements on risk quantification in Section 6, Sub-Section 2 (Articles 178- 184 of the CRR). This sub-section in the CRR covers aspects including representativeness, MoC and parameter estimations per grade or pool that lead to the quantification of the final parameters being applied in calculating RWE amounts. The CRR refers to parameter estimation where rules for quantification of PD and LGD estimates are set out (e.g. Article 180 of the CRR).

PARAGRAPH_105404: 7. The term 'calibration target' is not used in the CRR. However, where it is used in this section it refers to the value that is considered for the purpose of calibration in accordance with paragraph 161 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation. It should be noted that the specification of a calibration target in this sense and the estimation might coincide where institutions use LGD models (in the sense of Article 174 of the CRR) that assign exposures to facility grades or pools without providing for individual estimates of loss. In this case, the LGD model just

PARAGRAPH_105460: Three approaches to downturn LGD calibration

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:9]
PARAGRAPH_105461: 10.The centrepiece of the GL provides the policy for quantification of the calibration target for downturn LGD for one specific downturn period. However, the final RTS on economic downturn provides a notion of an economic downturn that might comprise several distinct downturn periods. Where more than one downturn period is identified, these GL specify that the downturn LGD has to be calibrated for each of those periods. The final downturn LGDs used for the calculation of capital requirements should then relate to the single downturn period leading to the highest average LGD (on a calibration segment) if the resulting estimates plus MoC are applied to the current non-defaulted portfolio at the time of calibration.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:9]
PARAGRAPH_105462: 11.In line with the general principle of the internal ratings-based approach that the quantification of risk parameters should be based on observed data, the calibration of downturn LGD should be based on the observed impact of the downturn period on the relevant losses, where possible, and, where not, it should make use of certain methodologies. The GL therefore differentiate between three approaches, introduced in paragraphs 23 to 25, which are increasing in prescriptiveness and with regard to aspects that need to be covered by appropriate MoC:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:9] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_105463: i. Type 1: downturn LGD calibration based on observed impact. Where sufficient (in terms of timespan covered and quantity of data, to arrive at stable estimates) loss data are available to assess the impact for the downturn period under consideration, which has been identified in accordance with the RTS on economic downturn, the institution should conduct a standardised impact assessment with a prescriptive minimum scope. The impact assessment requires that institutions analyse whether there is evidence of elevated realised LGDs, decreased annual recoveries, decreased number of cures (i.e. exposures that defaulted and returned to non-defaulted status) or prolonged time in default caused by the downturn period under consideration. Downturn LGD should then be calibrated for the downturn period under consideration in a way that it is coherent with the results obtained from that impact assessment, i.e. the institution is required to consider the results of the impact assessment and to model appropriately the loss components materially affected by the downturn period under consideration.

PARAGRAPH_105469: iii. Type 3: free modelling flexibility with minimum fixed add-on. Where sufficient data are not available to quantify downturn LGDs for the downturn period under consideration based on observed or estimated impact using the approaches outlined in points (i) and (ii) above, the institution still has to provide downturn LGD estimates, given the explicit requirement in the CRR. However, in this case, the estimates also need to fulfil a minimum level of MoC, covering the lack of data and methodological deficiencies. Moreover, the institution must justify to the satisfaction of the competent authority that it can apply neither the approach outlined in point (i) nor the approach outlined in point (ii) above. Under this third approach, it is required that the final downturn LGD estimates plus an appropriate MoC be higher than the corresponding long-run-average LGDs plus 15 percentage points (capped at a final downturn LGD estimate level of 105%).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:12]
PARAGRAPH_105504: 16. The GL clarify in paragraph 14(a) that downturn LGD should be calibrated at least at the same level as that at which the long-run average LGD is calculated for the purpose of calibrating LGD in accordance with paragraph 161 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation. The rationale for this is that downturn LGD estimation should be understood as risk quantification of LGD estimates appropriate for an economic downturn, i.e. that the downturn LGD calibration just provides a different calibration target from long-run average LGD and sets out additional requirements regarding the applicable MoC. Thus, if an institution considers the long-run average LGDs by grades or pools (in line with paragraph 161(a) of the GL on PD and LGD estimation) with the objective of calibrating LGD estimates for these grades or pools, it needs to consider the same level for quantifying downturn LGD. If an institution considers long-run average LGDs calculated at the level of calibration segments for the purpose of LGD calibration (in line with Article 161(b) of the GL on PD and LGD estimation), it needs to quantify downturn LGDs for the purpose of downturn LGD calibration at least by calibration segment.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:12] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_105505: 17.In addition paragraph 14(b) provides guidance on the use of calibration segments in downturn LGD estimation analogous to paragraph 97 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation, which provides guidance on the use of calibration segments for PD estimation. An institution should identify subsets of the type of exposure under consideration as calibration segments, where exposures in these subsets are covered by the same LGD model for assignment to facility grades but on average show significantly different loss profiles, and where exposures in these subsets are affected differently by downturn periods. At a minimum, banks are required to consider material subsets of exposures covering different geographical areas/jurisdictions or industry sectors or, in the case of retail, product types as calibration segments. The rationale for this minimum requirement is that economic factors in the RTS are required to be customised to each relevant jurisdiction and sector. A typical example of where the use of calibration segments should be considered is the situation when an LGD model is rolled out to a different jurisdiction. The drivers for LGD might be the same in a different jurisdiction and thus the LGD model might provide a reasonable risk differentiation in a different jurisdiction, but the overall loss profile might be significantly different due to, for example, different legal processes in the context of collateral liquidation. It may, however, also turn out that loss characteristics and levels are independent from, for example, jurisdictions or industry sectors, in which case the differentiation of calibration segments might not be necessary.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:13]
PARAGRAPH_105509: 18.The provision set out in paragraph 15 of the GL ensures that, as a general concept, an institution needs to estimate downturn LGDs appropriate to each downturn period identified in accordance with the RTS on economic downturn. As the approach in the RTS can lead to the identification of multiple downturn periods, institutions need to calibrate downturn LGD and provide the resulting LGD downturn estimates in relation to different downturn periods. Consequently, this may require institutions to calibrate downturn LGD based on different types of approaches (as described in section 2.5 of this Background and rationale), as loss data might be available for some identified downturn periods, but not for others.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:13]
PARAGRAPH_105510: 19.Given that, in the case of multiple downturn periods, institutions may have to use different approaches in order to set the calibration target, it is important to specify in detail how this interaction should work, which will in turn specify which final downturn LGD estimates should be selected. Therefore, three principles are laid down in the policy:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:13]
PARAGRAPH_105511: i. First, the proposed policy requires that the final downturn LGD estimates relate to one downturn period per calibration segment.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:13] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_105512: ii. Second, where for one of the downturn periods identified downturn LGD is calibrated using a type 3 approach and for another downturn period downturn LGD is calibrated using a type 1 or type 2 approach, then the latter shall be taken into account for the final LGD downturn estimates and an MoC needs to be added for the lack of analysis of one downturn period. In brief, downturn LGD estimation subject to the minimum add-on is disregarded where downturn LGD estimation is possible based on observed or estimated impact for any other downturn period subject to an additional appropriate MoC. Under no circumstances should this principle be abused to circumvent the obligatory use of type 2 approaches where their application is possible. Indeed, it is expected that type 3 approaches will be considered only in exceptional cases. Therefore, the waiver for downturn periods that require a type 3 approach as set out in paragraph 15(a)(iv) of the GL will be revised by the EBA, should there be indications of excessive or misuse of this waiver.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:13]
PARAGRAPH_105513: iii. Third, where LGD estimates are quantified for several downturn periods, institutions should choose as the finally relevant downturn period the period that results in the highest average downturn LGD for the calibration segment under consideration. It is important to note that this refers to the average downturn LGD of the latest available snapshot of the current non-defaulted portfolio at the time of calibration.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:13]
PARAGRAPH_105514: 20.The rationale for the first principle is that, where different calibration segments cover exposures from, for example, different jurisdictions, industry sectors or even product types for retail exposures, the multiple downturn periods will have different impacts on these calibration segments. The second principle is justified by the fact that the LGD estimates based on type 3 approaches are not based on observed or estimated impact on loss data and are therefore considered less reliable. The third principle ensures that the estimation is based on the downturn period that leads to the highest expected impact when applying the final downturn LGD estimation. In this context, it should be noted that theoretically an institution might have to apply a type 3 approach for several downturn periods and might not be able to

PARAGRAPH_105521: As an example, consider an obligor-based retail rating system covering three types of facilities: mortgages, consumer credits and overdrafts on current accounts. For the purpose of long-run average LGD calculation, the system differentiates between two calibration segments:

PARAGRAPH_105522: (A) mortgages; and (B) consumer credits and overdrafts on current accounts.

PARAGRAPH_105543: Moreover, this implies, for the example above, that the institution should estimate two downturn LGDs for the calibration segment (A) mortgages, one relating to downturn period 1 (1990-1991, specified based on the house price index) and another related to downturn period 2 (2008-2010, defined on the basis of GDP growth, unemployment rate and total household debt), and pick as the relevant downturn period the period that results in the higher of the two downturn LGD estimates, considered as averages at calibration segment level. This comparison is necessary because, otherwise, different grades could refer to different downturn periods, which would result in undue complexity and would lack economic rationale.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:15]
PARAGRAPH_105544: If the institution does not have, or is not able to estimate, an impact on loss data for the downturn period 1990-1991 and, therefore, the downturn LGD is subject to the minimum MoC requirement as set out in section 7, the latter will not be used when comparing it with the downturn LGD estimated for the downturn period 2008-2010 even if higher (unless the LGD for 2008-2010 is also estimated in accordance with methodologies described in section 7). However, an appropriate MoC should be added to the final downturn LGD estimate to cover the downturn period not analysed. Conversely, if the institution does not have data to estimate downturn LGDs based on observed impact related to the downturn period 1990-1991, but it is able to estimate downturn LGDs based on the estimated impact and in accordance with the methodologies described in section 6, then this estimation might be compared with the downturn LGD estimated for the downturn period 2008-2010. In this example, this is justified because it could be expected that the impact from the drop in the house price index observed in 1990-1991 characterises the more relevant downturn period for calibration segment A.

For this purpose, institutions should provide evidence that the economic factors underlying the downturn period under consideration are not relevant to the calibration segment under consideration. This will be the case mainly when downturn periods are defined based on sectoral or industry-specific factors and the calibration segments are also defined in terms of sectors or industry segments. In these cases, the downturn period defined based on economic indicators related to industry A will not be relevant to the calibration segment related to industry B. However, if the downturn period is defined based on economic indicators related to both industries A and B, this will also be relevant to the calibration segment related to industry B. Thus, in Example 1 above, the downturn period 1990-1991 may be disregarded for calibration segment B, consisting of consumer credits and overdrafts, when properly justified.

PARAGRAPH_105552: 24. The policy proposed in paragraph 16 of the GL provides guidance related to the first sentence of Article 181(1)(b) of the CRR, which requires that institutions use LGD estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn if those are more conservative than the long-run average LGD (LRA). The GL clarify how this requirement should be interpreted in the context of calibration of downturn LGD. It should be noted, however, that this requirement to compare downturn and long-run average LGD used for calibration is without prejudice to the requirement in Article 181(1)(b) of the CRR to ensure that the actual downturn LGD estimates are used (in application) if they are more conservative than long-run average LGDs. In general, and technically speaking, downturn LGD may be calibrated in either of the following ways:

PARAGRAPH_105555: 25.For the purpose of providing guidance on the CRR article in question, it seemed helpful to differentiate the two different technical approaches. In order to comply with the requirement that the higher of the long-run average and the downturn LGD estimate constitutes the final LGD estimate, paragraph 16 requires that the long-run average LGD plus the corresponding MoC be compared with the corresponding downturn LGD plus the corresponding MoC at the level relevant to the calibration. Although paragraph 14 allows downturn LGDs to be calibrated on a more granular level than the long-run average LGD, it is expected that generally the level of calibration for long-run average LGD and downturn LGD will be the same. In exceptional cases, however, where banks use a more granular level for the calibration of downturn LGD, institutions need to provide a meaningful aggregation in order to compare the downturn and long-run average LGDs used for calibration.

PARAGRAPH_105559: However, where a downturn adjustment is applied to the long-run average LGD, this requirement implies that the MoC applied to the final LGD estimate (i.e. LRA + downturn adjustment + MoC) needs to account for both (i) the uncertainty related to the estimation of long-run average LGD and (ii) the uncertainty related to the calculation of the downturn adjustment.

PARAGRAPH_105563: 26.Paragraph 17 of the GL relates to the second sentence of Article 181(1)(b) of the CRR, which requires that institutions make adjustments to their estimates of risk parameters by grade or pool to limit the capital impact of an economic downturn if a rating system is expected to deliver realised LGDs at a constant level by grade or pool over time. The EBA considers that this provision is meant to ensure that the capital impact that stems from the migrations between facility grades and pools (e.g. in cases where risk drivers sensitive to the economic cycle are used) does not lead over time to an over- or underestimation of the LGDs appropriate for an economic downturn. This provision, however, targets migrations caused by changes in the economic cycle. Structural changes over time in a portfolio under consideration (which might also be caused by changes in economic conditions, e.g. due to tightened underwriting standards) are a matter of representativeness and should be treated in accordance with section 4 of the GL on PD and LGD. This entails in particular that institutions should assume that no exposures would have been newly added to a calibration segment and that no exposures would have left a calibration segment due to orderly termination of the contract, when considering the likely distribution of the current portfolio affected by the relevant downturn period.

PARAGRAPH_105568: As an example, a simplified LGD model for a retail mortgage portfolio with just one risk driver, in this case the loan-to-value ratio (LTV), could be considered. Thus, the LTV buckets define the pools of the LGD model under consideration. It is assumed that this LTV is defined as an updated LTV, i.e. an LTV metric where house price index (HPI) variations affect the value of the collateral and hence the denominator of the LTV metric. Thus, this risk driver is sensitive to the economic cycle (as defined by the economic factor HPI).

PARAGRAPH_105569: In order to illustrate the impact of migrations caused by the economic cycle via such a risk driver on the distribution of facilities over grades and thus the final downturn LGD estimation, it is assumed that the composition of the portfolio remains constant1. In this case, when moving into an upturn, house prices might increase (HPI increase) and, since the LTV is affected by such increases, facilities tend to migrate to better LTV grades (i.e. LTVs tend to decrease). In the illustration below, the yellow band represents LTVs of 100% or higher, the grey band represents LTVs between 80% and 100%, the red band represents LTVs between 40% and 80%, and the blue band represents LTVs between 0% and 40%:

PARAGRAPH_105637: 27.In summary, Example 3 illustrates that, in cases of LGD models based on risk drivers sensitive to the economic cycle, the impact on the current capital requirements of an upcoming economic upturn (or downturn) is twofold: (i) the impact stemming from the expected lower (or higher) realised economic losses per facility (in the event of a downturn, this is covered by the downturn LGD estimation by grade) and (ii) the impact stemming from the migrations of facilities to lower (or higher) LTV bands.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:19]
PARAGRAPH_105638: 28.It is indeed true that the loss rates in the higher LTV bands already reflect the expected realised LGDs under upcoming downturn conditions. The expected realised loss (in contrast to the loss rates) will, however, be higher, due to the higher proportion of facilities that migrate to the higher LTV bands.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:19]
PARAGRAPH_105639: 29. The provision in paragraph 17 serves the purpose of ensuring that those LGD models that are based on risk drivers sensitive to the economic cycle appropriately estimate the economic loss (appropriate for an economic downturn) in the current state of the economic cycle at the time of calibration. The provision thus contains an expectation that for those LGD models an adjustment to the downturn LGDs should be applied that is higher in a favourable economic state of the economic cycle (at the time of calibration or recalibration) and smaller in an adverse state of the economic cycle (at the time of calibration or recalibration). If, however, the institution applies a downturn estimation methodology that incorporates this expectation (e.g. where the risk drivers are adjusted to reflect downturn conditions), then there is no need for additional adjustments. Indeed, the application of paragraph 17 of the GL should in no case lead to a double incorporation of the impact of an economic downturn. In this context, institutions should take into account that the underlying LGD model has to provide for

PARAGRAPH_105644: 30.In this context, it should be recalled that section 9 of the GL on PD and LGD also applies to downturn LGD estimation and that in the light of paragraph 17 it might be necessary in the review of downturn LGD estimates to consider the effects of recent changes in the economic conditions on the current portfolio and where necessary recalibrate the final downturn LGD estimates.

PARAGRAPH_105645: 31.Paragraph 18 sets out the requirement to compare the resulting downturn LGD at the level of calibration segments (on the reference data set, RDS) with a reference value, which should be calculated following the rules set out in section 8 of the GL. The reference value is a challenger value; in the event of a material difference between the reference value and the downturn LGD estimates, this should be justified based on the guidance laid down in paragraph 19.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:20] [RISK:OPERATIONAL_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_105646: 32.In fact, the reference value can be driven by other issues than the impact of an economic downturn period (e.g. low number of defaults, changes in the portfolio composition, fraud or operational risk cases, or even natural disasters such as an earthquake). Even if the reference value is driven by an economic downturn period, the reference value itself should not be considered an appropriate quantification of downturn LGD (as it may not comply with all the requirements laid down in these GL). Therefore, specifically if downturn LGD estimation is based on type 1 approaches, institutions may use the evidence gathered from the impact assessment set out in paragraph 27 of the GL for the justification of the material difference. On the other hand, the selected years of the reference value might also point to a previously unidentified downturn period.

PARAGRAPH_105647: 33.It is important to stress the non-binding character of the reference value. In fact, as stated before, the reference value will generally not comply with the rules set out in these GL and should therefore not be used as a calibration target for downturn LGD estimation. In addition, it should be noted that the result of the re-assessment required by paragraph 19 may (and will in many cases) be that the downturn LGD estimation is appropriate.

PARAGRAPH_105650: 35.Section 4.2 of these GL provides guidance on the downturn LGD estimation for defaulted exposures. As a precondition to apply the policy laid down in this section, the institution should have identified the finally relevant downturn period per calibration segment for the non- defaulted exposures. As a general rule, for defaulted exposures, institutions should apply the GL for downturn LGD estimation for each reference date, but only in relation to the downturn period identified as relevant to the respective non-defaulted exposures. This will ensure that both LGD in default and LGD for non-defaulted exposures are based on the very same downturn period.

In this context, it should be noted that the GL text in paragraph 21(b) refers to the downturn component for defaulted exposures at the moment of default. This is relevant, as in the event of partial write-offs at the moment of default the loss related to these write-offs will be relevant to the downturn LGD for non- defaulted exposure, but might not be taken into account for downturn LGD for defaulted exposure at the moment of default where compliant with paragraph 179 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation.

PARAGRAPH_105674: Principle 1:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:22]
PARAGRAPH_105675: "Where the approach used involves the estimation or analysis of different intermediate parameters, the aggregation of these intermediate parameters for the purpose of calibrating downturn LGD should start with the parameter where the highest impact is observed in accordance with paragraph 27 or estimated in accordance with paragraph 30 and any additional impact observed or estimated on other parameters should be added where necessary."

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:22]
PARAGRAPH_105676: 41. The rationale for this principle is that it may be necessary under both type 1 as well as under type 2 approaches to aggregate the impact of a considered downturn period on different intermediate parameters, such as cure rate or recovery rate. The principle ensures that offsetting effects are not taken into account and provides more guidance related to the requirement that institutions should quantify downturn LGDs in a way that is coherent with the evidence found in the impact assessment for type 1 methodologies. The highest impact in this context should, for type 1 methodologies, refer to the highest relative change when comparing the evidence found in the impact assessment with the average value of each component.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:23]
PARAGRAPH_105683: 43. The rationale for this principle is that in fact, where realised LGDs are computed with respect to the time of default but with long recovery processes, compensation effects might absorb a potential downturn impact. Indeed, it could be the case that, whereas the date of default reflected downturn conditions, the assets may be sold for a higher price once economic conditions have recovered - effectively leading to an economic loss reflecting economic upturn rather than downturn conditions.

One way of how institutions could ensure this in case of type 1 methodologies can be illustrated by the following simplified example:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:23]
PARAGRAPH_105686: Assume the institution found evidence of:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:23]
PARAGRAPH_105687: i. an increase of about 2% in realised LGDs due to the downturn period under consideration;

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:23]
PARAGRAPH_105688: ii. a decrease of about 15% in annual recoveries due to the downturn period under consideration.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:23] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_105689: For simplicity, assume that no evidence was found on the other components. In order to comply with paragraph 28 (to provide a downturn LGD estimate coherent with the results of the impact assessment), the institution could transfer the observed decrease in annual recoveries as a result of the downturn period to all facilities in the reference data set (as defined in the EBA GL on PD and LGD) that were not affected by the downturn period, and recalculate downturn LGD. The resulting downturn LGD might already cover the impact observed on the realised LGDs. If not, the additional impact observed should be added. There are, however, other possible ways institutions could ensure that that all impact observed or estimated on different components is covered, e.g. the institution could choose a model for calibrating downturn LGD based on model components and set the level of the component under consideration to the impact observed or estimated and check whether the resulting downturn LGD estimates cover for the impact observed on realised LGD.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:24] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_105694: 44.It is worth noting that the guidance laid down in these GL builds on the general presumption of the advanced IRB approach (i.e. where the institution uses own estimates of LGDs) where risk parameters are quantified based on observed data. Therefore, as a first step and in line with the hierarchy of approaches, an institution needs to assess whether for a type of exposure under consideration sufficient loss data are available to assess the impact of a considered downturn period identified in accordance with the RTS on economic downturn. If that is the case, the institution follows the guidance for downturn LGD estimation based on observed impact laid down in this section.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:24] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_105695: 45.In order to ensure that all relevant aspects of the economic loss calculated in accordance with subsection 6.3.1 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation are covered appropriately, the minimum components of such an impact assessment are prescribed in paragraph 27 of the GL. In detail, the proposed impact assessment requires institutions to analyse whether there is evidence of impact of the downturn period under consideration on the four following components, namely (i) elevated realised LGDs; (ii) decreased annual recoveries; (iii) decreased number of facilities returned to non-defaulted status in a predefined time horizon, which should be appropriate for the type of exposure and reflect the usual time to cure; and (iv) prolonged time in default.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:24]
PARAGRAPH_105696: 46. Regarding the first two components, the required analysis touches upon the issue on whether the impact of an economic downturn should be considered with respect to the date of default or with respect to the date of receiving the material share of the recovery cash flows. On the one hand, considering the realised LGDs with respect to the time in default is more consistent with the calculation of RWE amounts, where the expected loss is expressed as the product of PD and LGD, i.e. implying that it refers to the same reference point in time. On the other hand, considering the impact on annual recoveries per source of cash flow (regardless of the dates of default) might better reflect the economic loss appropriate for an economic downturn. Indeed, it could be the case that, although the date of default reflected downturn conditions, collateral may be sold for a higher price once economic conditions have recovered - effectively leading to collateral prices reflecting economic upturn rather than downturn conditions. Because of these considerations, the proposed impact assessment requires both types of analyses in paragraph 27(a), points (i) and (ii).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:24]
PARAGRAPH_105697: 47.Moreover, for the analysis in paragraph 27(a)(i) the data need to be split into two subsets. One set should contain all facilities which have reached their maximum time to recovery as defined in paragraph 156 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation or which have been closed before they reached this point in time. The other set should contain all incomplete recovery processes that have not reached their maximum time to recovery. In a second step, evidence of impact of the downturn period under consideration should be analysed separately for the set containing complete recovery processes and those that have reached their maximum time to recovery, and for the set containing incomplete recovery processes. For the latter set, the impact on the recovery pattern for each vintage of default should be analysed and may provide input for, in particular, the downturn LGD estimation for defaulted exposure.

PARAGRAPH_105701: 48. The analysis of the additional components set out in paragraph 27(a), points (iii) and (iv), namely the decreased number of facilities returned to non-defaulted status and the prolonged time in default respectively, ensures the inclusion of the potential impact of a considered downturn period which may not be measurable at the level of the average realised LGD or annual recoveries. Indeed, if, for example, an impact is measurable only with respect to a material increase of observed time in default, this analysis will ensure the incorporation of the downturn impact into the LGD estimation, for example by applying the increased time in default to the observations. The same principle applies to facilities returned to non-defaulted status.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:25]
PARAGRAPH_105702: 49.Paragraph 27(b) of the GL accounts for situations in which one or several of the outlined analyses cannot be meaningfully conducted due to insufficient coverage of loss data during one year of a multi-year downturn period. This should not be confused with a situation in which no data are available for the considered downturn period because of this period being too far back in time. However, in order to account for the issue of scarce data, the policy allows the merging of consecutive years of observations as long as it is deemed of benefit for the analysis.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:25]
PARAGRAPH_105703: 50.Finally, the last paragraph on the impact assessment requires that any lag between a downturn period and its potential impact on the relevant loss data has to be taken into account. Due to the individual situations regarding data availability as well as the specifics of a considered type of exposure, no guidance is set out regarding the length of the time lags that should be considered.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:25] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_105704: 51.The guidance regarding the calibration of downturn LGD for cases in which loss data are available to assess the impact of a considered downturn period on a considered calibration segment is laid down in section 5 of the final GL. Paragraph 28 clarifies that the resulting LGD estimation needs to be coherent with the outcome obtained from the impact analysis. In other words, the final downturn LGDs should appropriately account for the material impacts of a considered downturn period on (i) the realised LGDs; (ii) the annual recoveries; (ii) the facilities returned to non-defaulted status; and (iv) time in default. The policy leaves flexibility to institutions with respect to the detailed methodology applied for the purpose of calibration of downturn LGD based on results of the impact assessment. The rationale for this is that the EBA considers that there is no one-size-fits-all aggregation scheme for the results obtained from the analyses required in paragraph 27. Depending on the risk profile of the considered type of exposure it might be appropriate to choose the average LGD by vintage of defaults affected by the considered downturn period where this best reflects the results obtained from the impact assessment laid down in paragraph 27(a), points (i) to (iv). In another case, in particular where the average LGD would incorporate significant catch-up effects due to late recoveries when economic conditions improved (as outlined in paragraph 45 above), it might be more appropriate to base the downturn LGD estimation on the impact observed on annual recoveries per source of cash flow. The flexibility to select an appropriate methodology to calibrate downturn LGD includes the ability to use the 'haircut approach', outlined in section 6 in the GL, as a methodology under section 5 of the GL.

For example, setting a downturn haircut (based on observed loss data) on only the best-quality collateral based on materiality, in order to reflect the results obtained from the impact assessment, may not be a compliant approach, as it could lead to incentives to use less good-quality collateral.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:26] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_105710: 53. The impact analysis is particularly important to ensure that the long-run average LGD may be deemed appropriate as a downturn LGD estimate only when no impact of a considered downturn period can be observed on the relevant loss data and realised LGDs. The detailed conditions under which the long-run average LGD including the corresponding MoC may be appropriate for the final downturn LGD appropriate for an economic downturn are laid down in paragraph 29. It should be noted that only if observed data are available for a considered downturn period may the long-run average LGD (under certain conditions) be considered an appropriate downturn LGD estimate. In particular, it is required that the MoC under consideration cover for all additional elements of uncertainty related to the identified downturn periods, including deficiencies identified under Category A in accordance with paragraph 37(a) of the GL on PD and LGD estimation, and under Category B in accordance with paragraph 37(b) of the GL on PD and LGD estimation.

PARAGRAPH_105713: 54.If no sufficient data are available to calibrate downturn LGD in accordance with the proposed policy described above, institutions should aim to calibrate their downturn LGDs based on the estimated impact of the downturn period under consideration. However, institutions should estimate that impact by applying either a haircut or an extrapolation approach. Where institutions have observed data for only a certain intermediate parameter or risk driver reflecting the impact of the downturn period under consideration, institutions should estimate the realised historical LGDs (which they have not observed) affected by the downturn period under consideration by combining the observed impact on the intermediate parameter or risk driver with the estimated impact of other intermediate parameters resulting from a haircut and/or extrapolation approach. As stated above, both approaches can be used to estimate unobserved realised LGDs or intermediate parameters or risk drivers from the past.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:26]
PARAGRAPH_105714: 55.The haircut approach provides an estimate indirectly by adjusting (i.e. applying a haircut to) the input variables of the LGD model. Thus, a haircut approach relies on the functional relationship that is established in the model between realised losses and certain input parameters. In particular, in order to apply a haircut approach, this functional relationship needs to describe the dependency of the LGD estimate on several risk drivers, of which at least one is an economic factor. This might especially be the case when collateral values are used as risk drivers . The downturn LGD estimate is then computed by applying the LGD model where the above-mentioned economic factor (or even factors) is/are adjusted to reflect the level observed in the downturn period under consideration. The haircut approach may equally be applied to intermediate risk parameters or risk drivers.

PARAGRAPH_105718: 56.The extrapolation approach is a methodology to enable the institution to estimate downturn LGDs based on estimated historical loss data (based on backward extrapolation). This approach estimates 'realised' historical LGDs, intermediate parameters or even risk drivers that serve as an input into the LGD estimation model under consideration, by extrapolating them backwards in time based on the statistical dependency between the realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers and the relevant economic factors. It is worth noting that this dependency needs to be established using the observed loss data.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:27]
PARAGRAPH_105719: 57. The main difference from the haircut approach is that the extrapolation approach derives the calibration target for downturn LGD based on the RDS and a statistical model for the dependency between realised LGDs (aggregated at different points in time) and economic factors, whereas the haircut approach derives the calibration target for downturn LGD by applying an existing LGD estimation model to the current exposures using input variables adjusted to reflect downturn conditions.

PARAGRAPH_105720: 58.Finally, it is worth noting that, when the haircut or extrapolation approach is applied, a strictly positive Category A Moc8 needs to be applied to reflect the related uncertainty with respect to the estimated impact. This is laid down in paragraph 35 of the GL.

Under this approach, the impact of a considered downturn period on the realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers of a considered type of exposure is estimated by applying the LGD model using adjusted input parameters. Therefore, a precondition for the applicability of this approach is that the LGD model takes one or several economic factors as direct or transformed input. Then, when the LGD model is applied, these economic factors are adjusted to reflect the values of the economic factors observed in economic downturn conditions instead of applying the current values of these economic factors).

PARAGRAPH_105808: 61.The policy in paragraph 30 requires the use of a haircut approach if both of the following conditions are fulfilled:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:31]
PARAGRAPH_105809: i. There are not sufficient data to calibrate downturn LGDs based on observed impact on loss data (i.e. the policy laid down in paragraph 24 applies).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:31]
PARAGRAPH_105810: ii. An economic factor that has been identified as a relevant economic factor in accordance with Article 2 of the RTS on economic downturn relates to a relevant type of collateral for the type of exposure under consideration and is a direct or transformed input of the institution's model for LGD estimation.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:31]
PARAGRAPH_105811: 62.Two remarks are important to make. First, it should be noted that the mandatory use of the haircut approach is related to the situation where the LGD estimation model takes as one of its inputs the economic factor related to a relevant collateral type for the type of exposure under consideration (e.g. market values or a market index). In this case, the policy prescribes that the actual haircut (i.e. the adjustment of the economic factor which serves as input into the model to reflect downturn conditions) should be based on the most severe observed value of the market price, or market price index, in accordance with the specification of the severity of an economic downturn in accordance with Article 3 of the RTS on economic downturn. Second, institutions may also apply a haircut approach where applicable, i.e. where an economic factor is a direct or transformed input to the LGD model and is not related to the relevant collateral types to calibrate downturn LGD estimates. If for example the GDP is a direct or transformed input into the LGD model, a haircut approach may be used as well, but it is not mandatory.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:31]
PARAGRAPH_105812: 63.Finally, it should be mentioned that institutions that have to quantify LGD based on the observed impact of an economic downturn on loss data, as set out in paragraph 23 of the GL, are not prohibited from using haircut approaches for the purpose of calibrating their LGD model to the quantification of downturn LGD estimations achieved in accordance with paragraph 23 of the GL. An institution that has observed loss data affected by an economic downturn for a type of exposure under consideration needs to calculate haircuts such that the resulting downturn LGD estimates reflect the observed impact from an economic downturn (i.e. to reach the calibration target) in accordance with paragraph 28 of the GL, whereas an institution that does not have such data needs to consider haircuts in accordance with the downturn severities observed in respect of the corresponding economic factors in accordance with paragraph 31 of the GL, and add an additional MoC.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:31]
PARAGRAPH_105814: 64.Paragraph 32 of the final GL describes the extrapolation approach and sets out requirements for the application of this approach. For the purpose of these GL, 'the extrapolation approach' refers to a methodology to estimate realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or even risk drivers that serve as an input into the LGD estimation model under consideration. These estimated realised LGDs (or intermediate parameters or risk drivers) are extrapolated backwards in time based on the dependency of the realised LGDs (or intermediate parameters

PARAGRAPH_105847: 65. The extrapolation approach has, however, been perceived as potentially leading to less conservative results and might also suffer from uncertainty about whether or not the derived dependency will also apply under non-observed downturn conditions. Therefore, a requirement is added in paragraph 35 to cover the additional uncertainty related to the use of the extrapolation approach with an additional MoC.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:33]
PARAGRAPH_105849: Considering the previous example, it could be assumed for simplicity that the methodology applied for the regression discards all but one economic factor, e.g. GDP of the past year. In this case, the error of this model could be assessed as Yo - Yo for a chosen point in time to (where the internal loss would need to be extrapolated) and the following could be used as an estimator for the variance of the residuals (under the assumption that the residuals are normally distributed), where n denotes the number of observations (points in time) used for the regression:

PARAGRAPH_105857: 66.It may be the case that only for a major share of economic loss the impact of a considered downturn period can be estimated by a haircut or extrapolation approach. There may, however, be other, less significant (but not immaterial), components of economic loss where the impact of the downturn period under consideration can be estimated by neither a haircut nor an extrapolation approach. In order not to push these cases under the scope of application of section 7, the EBA considers it appropriate to allow an estimation of the impact on these less significant components based on observed data from a different period than from the downturn period under consideration, yet still with the objective of estimating the impact of the downturn period under consideration. This is included in paragraph 32(b)(ii) of the draft GL.

PARAGRAPH_105928: 69.Section 7 (paragraph 36) of these GL allows for exceptional cases: where neither the approach outlined in section 5 nor the approach laid down in section 6 can be applied, and where institutions can justify to the satisfaction of the competent authority that none of the approaches is applicable, the institution may apply any alternative methodology to calibrate downturn LGD estimates. Where this approach needs to be applied, the institution can rely only on observed loss data during favourable economic conditions for the type of exposure under consideration (as otherwise the approach set out in section 5 would be applicable). As the institution applies a calibration methodology which might be more favourable than those outlined in section 6, it needs to quantify an MoC in relation to this downturn LGD estimation such that the final downturn LGD estimate including MoC is higher than or equal to the long- run average LGD plus 15 percentage points. In any case, the final downturn LGD estimate should be lower than or equal to 105%.

PARAGRAPH_105934: 2.10 Remarks

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:36]
PARAGRAPH_105935: 71.It should be clear from the policy as well as from the rationale outlined above that there is a hierarchy of the approaches to quantification of downturn LGD estimates. This hierarchy is outlined in paragraphs 23 to 25 of the GL. Where loss data affected by a downturn period are available, the institution needs to follow the policy set out in section 5 of the final GL. Otherwise, the institution needs to follow the policy set out in section 6 and only in very exceptional cases should downturn LGD estimates be calibrated in accordance with section 7. This approach should make downturn LGD estimation more transparent and comparable than in the past. At the same time, it is aimed at providing sufficient flexibility for the institutions. The policy will make it easier to distinguish risk-based variability in applied LGD parameters from variability stemming from other sources.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:36]
PARAGRAPH_105936: 72. The policy also accounts for situations in which the observed impact of an economic downturn on the relevant loss data is zero or near zero. In addition, it clarifies the terminology by distinguishing between the identified economic downturn for a type of exposure under consideration and its impact, i.e. by noting that, if the relevant loss data show no impact of an economic downturn, it does not necessarily mean that there is no economic downturn or that there will be no impact in the future. Although there might be cases in which the identified economic factors do not show a cyclical pattern, the RTS on economic downturn provide a clear definition that works independently of such patterns (which could also just reflect very long cycles). Moreover, it should be noted that the notion of the duration provided in Article 3 of the RTS on economic downturn is particularly relevant to applying the policy laid down in paragraph 27 of the final GL and the notion of severity is particularly relevant to applying the policy laid down in paragraph 31 of the GL.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:36]
PARAGRAPH_105937: 73.As mentioned before, flexibility is left with regard to the calibration methodology as long as the calibration target, i.e. the downturn LGD, complies with the rules set out in these GL.

PARAGRAPH_106133: While the proposed RTS aim to harmonise the definition of an economic downturn, these guidelines focus on the estimation of downturn LGD per se. Indeed, both the definition of an economic downturn and the downturn LGD estimation have been identified in different reports (from the EBA 11 as well as from the industry) as key drivers of non-risk-based variability of capital requirements. All issues that have been considered while developing the RTS and these guidelines relate to the identification and/or limitation of drivers of unjustified RWA variability in the context of downturn LGD.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:51]

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:51]
PARAGRAPH_106137: The guidelines introduce three different type of approaches to estimate the downturn LGD, taking into account the data availability of the institution. The most appropriate approach should be used.

Finally, if no such data are available and the limited set of methodologies cannot be applied either, the institution still has to provide downturn LGD estimates (as this is a CRR requirement) but needs to include a margin of conservatism, covering for the lack of data and methodological deficiencies. Under this third and final approach, it is required that the final downturn LGD estimates include an appropriate margin of conservatism and be higher than the corresponding long-run-average LGD estimates plus 15% (capped at a final downturn LGD estimate of 105%).

PARAGRAPH_106219: 242. In nearly half of the LGD models, the downturn adjustment is specified at the level of the LGD model, whereas in smaller shares of models, the downturn adjustment is specified at a lower level: at the level of the grade or pool (in 27% of models), differentiated according to the type of collateral (9%) or differentiated by product type (2%) (see Figure 52). In around 4% of models, the downturn adjustment is specified uniformly in the institution. Some respondents (around 6%) mentioned that the downturn adjustment is applied at model component level, in which case it is not entirely clear whether this leads to a different adjustment by grade or pool, collateral, or product type, or whether this leads to a uniform adjustment for all exposures under the scope of application of the LGD model.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:57]
PARAGRAPH_106284: - The capital impact of an economic downturn should be limited at the portfolio level through a calibration methodology that reflects the facility-grade distribution of exposures at the point in time at which the downturn impact was observed. The rationale for this is that capital requirements stemming from the downturn LGD estimation should not increase in the event of an economic downturn but rather be appropriate for an economic downturn as required in Article 181 (1)(b) regardless of the current state of the economy.

PARAGRAPH_106330: 237. The IRB survey then enquired how institutions select data once the downturn period is established to compute the long-run average LGD. Based on the responses, however, it appears that this question was not properly understood, since nearly 50% of original responses were for the category 'other' and provided a wide range of explanations not answering the question. As a result, many of the responses have been discarded because the explanations given responded to a different question. This was the case when it was mentioned, for instance, that the data used in downturn estimation are selected based on expert judgement, or based on historical time series, etc. The results shown in Figure 51 are therefore based on a much smaller sample of LGD models than those represented in Table 57 (148 instead of 202).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:59]
PARAGRAPH_106331: 238. In nearly 40% of LGD models, the data used in downturn estimation are selected based on all observed defaults during the whole observation period to which an adjustment is made, to take into account downturn conditions, whereas in 17% of models all defaults that occurred during the downturn period are included.

PARAGRAPH_106332: 239. In 19% of models, those exposures for which the recoveries occurred in the downturn period are selected (e.g. assigning exposures to a downturn period if the majority of the realised recoveries are observed during the downturn period). In two institutions, the data are selected according to defaulted exposures for which the recovery process starts during the downturn period. However, in around 15% of models defaulted exposures are selected for which the recovery process closes during the downturn period.

PARAGRAPH_106336: 240. Among the responses in the category 'other', one institution mentioned that it selects the data used in downturn estimation according to exposures that default during the downturn period. One institution mentioned a three-step approach: (1) downturn periods are identified if the house price index has decreased; (2) the average house price decline during the downturn period is calculated; and (3) the recovery rate under downturn periods is computed by subtracting the average house price decline from the usual recovery rate. Other institutions mentioned a combination of selecting all exposures that defaulted during the downturn period for the unsecured part of the exposure, and selecting all exposures for which the recovery process ends during the downturn period for the secured part of the exposure.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:69]
PARAGRAPH_106520: Another respondent pointed out its doubts about the compliance of the 20-years approach with Articles 145 and 176 of the CRR, and considered that, at least, the approach of penalising institutions that cannot collect 20 years' data was unfair.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:69]
PARAGRAPH_106521: The EBA considers that the uncertainty of the impact of a downturn period is higher where such a downturn has not been observed. An additional MoC for a lack of such observed impact on loss data is therefore covered by Article 179 of the CRR, requiring a margin of conservatism to be added to an institution's estimates where methods and data are considered less satisfactory.

PARAGRAPH_106538: Several respondents proposed exempting downturn periods that are identified by the existence of potential structural breaks. As an example, one respondent pointed out that the 2003 peak in the unemployment rate in Germany relates to the social reforms and redefinition of unemployment rate rather than to a change in economic conditions.

PARAGRAPH_106540: Question 2

PARAGRAPH_106541: Some respondents considered the analysis of multiple downturn periods not relevant where a major macroeconomic crisis is already considered in the observed or estimated impact.

PARAGRAPH_106542: The EBA discussed this view but finally concluded that excluding such situations would, apart from the problem of defining a major macroeconomic crisis, lead to an uneven playing field. Analysis of the recent crisis showed that, for example, in some jurisdictions the housing market was hit, whereas in others no impact on house prices was observed. Just relying on the last major macroeconomic crisis would thus lead to an non-level playing field for mortgage portfolios in the EU.

PARAGRAPH_106577: Question 4

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:72]
PARAGRAPH_106578: Regarding the haircut approach, one respondent claimed that it is not clear if this economic indicator needs to be drawn from the mandatory list of indicators used to identify downturn. If it is not, and the downturn period can be identified using a different set of macroeconomic indicators from those that drive internal loss experience, there is no guarantee that the values of the economic indicators used to model loss will be conservative during the previously identified downturn period.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:72]
PARAGRAPH_106579: The GL start from the assumption that there is already an LGD model to assign facilities to grades or pools. If this model contains economic factors, then these should also be identified as additional relevant economic factors under Article 2 of the RTS. For the downturn periods constituted by economic factors that are used as inputs to the LGD models, the GL prescribe that the haircuts should be based on the most severe observations of these economic factors in accordance with the specification of the severity of an economic downturn laid down in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) xx/xx [RTS on economic downturn]. However, there could be other downturn periods constituted by economic factors that are not inputs of the LGD model. In that case, the GL still allow the use of the haircut approach to estimate the impact of the downturn period under consideration, but no rules as regards the setting of the haircut are set out.

PARAGRAPH_106582: The most severe value of an economic factor is clearly described in the specification of the severity of an economic downturn laid down in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) xx/xx [RTS on economic downturn].

PARAGRAPH_106591: Question 4

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:73]
PARAGRAPH_106592: The general assumption of the approach is that a dependency between observed realised LGDs and macroeconomic variables exists. This is probably true given a long observation period with different macroeconomic circumstances, but may not apply to any observation period. Nevertheless, in particular given a retail portfolio with a large number of observations, a statistical model may derive a dependency between the observed realised LGDs and a macroeconomic factor although the underlying observation period covers a stable economic environment. In fact, the derived dependency is just a pseudo-correlation, and the LGDs obtained by backward extrapolation are unsuited for calculating the downturn add-on.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:73]
PARAGRAPH_106593: Paragraph 32 has been amended to allow backwards extrapolation based on observed data as well if no statistical dependency to the economic factors underlying the downturn period under consideration can be established. However, this approach is subject to a number of requirements ensuring a clear distinction from cases when type 3 methodologies need to be considered.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:77]
PARAGRAPH_106654: As pointed out above, the calibration of an appropriate add-on is challenging in the light of the nature of type 3 approaches. Therefore, a further differentiation of the add-on has not been considered.

PARAGRAPH_106660: Question 10: Is the policy regarding the reference value sufficiently clear? Alongside the potentially limited applicability of the reference value to the downturn LGD estimation according to paragraphs 18-19-20, for what reasons could the reference value feasibly be omitted? Do you agree to the proposed clarification of the role of the reference value?

PARAGRAPH_106661: A majority of respondents questioned the use of the reference value, referring to its inappropriateness and lack of comparability in the light of the lack of linkage of its results to the actual downturn conditions

PARAGRAPH_106672: One respondent claimed that using the reference value as a challenger would work for type 3 models only, while for sounder type 1 models the reference value might be inappropriate, as it might represent a floor difficult to compare with the results from the models.

PARAGRAPH_106673: It is clarified in paragraph 19 that the reference value does not represent a floor.

PARAGRAPH_106677: Some respondents pointed out that comparison in the case of type 1 and 2 methods is difficult and imposes an additional burden of proof on the institutions. In the light of that, some of the respondents proposed disregarding the reference value in the new framework or, instead, using it as a replacement for the type 3 approach currently proposed.

PARAGRAPH_106678: As pointed out in the Background and rationale, the EBA considers that the non-binding character of the reference value should be noted. As stated in the Background and rationale, the reference value will generally not comply with the rules set out in these GL and should therefore not be used as a calibration target for downturn LGD estimation. The EBA considers the reference value nevertheless to be a meaningful supervisory tool, which supports the supervisory assessment of the resulting downturn LGD estimates and can support institutions in understanding the dynamics of their realised LGDs over time.

PARAGRAPH_106693: Some respondents claimed that the reference value layer of computation should be reconsidered whenever the two years with the highest losses are based on a low number of observations.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:79]
PARAGRAPH_106694: The EBA considers that, in particular in those situations, the use of the reference value as an indicator for increased losses due to economic downturn conditions is not straightforward.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:79]
PARAGRAPH_106695: A couple of respondents pointed out that the highest realised ratio to the exposure value does not necessarily have to be accompanied by the highest economic loss in the numerator in the case of greater portfolio exposure fluctuations. The comparison of the LGD weighted by the occurrences of default with an LGD weighted by the exposure makes no sense.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:79]
PARAGRAPH_106696: The EBA is aware of the inconsistency between the reference value as an exposure-weighted quantity and the downturn LGD as a case-weighted quantity. As pointed out above, the EBA nevertheless considers the reference value to be a meaningful supervisory tool, which supports the supervisory assessment of the resulting downturn LGD estimates and can support institutions in understanding the dynamics of their realised LGDs over time.

PARAGRAPH_106697: Three respondents highlighted a lack of explanation of how to treat the correlation among different intermediate parameters of the calculation. In particular, the respondents asked for clarity on (i) the way the reference value should be calculated, e.g. aggregating the reference values for each model component together (i.e. [avg. worst two cure rates + avg. worst two LGD secured]?) and (ii) whether the two worst years over 20 years should be

PARAGRAPH_106708: One respondent pointed out that the reference value concept might not work at all for regression-type models producing a range of LGD estimates for each calibration segment (not a unique single downturn LGD for each calibration segment).

PARAGRAPH_106709: Paragraph 18 sets out the requirement to compare the resulting downturn LGD with the reference value calculated in accordance with section 8 on the corresponding RDS and calculated at least at the level of calibration segments. In practice, for regression- type models this might require calculating the downturn LGDs for each facility in the RDS and averaging it at the level of calibration segments.
