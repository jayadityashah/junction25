[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_94985: The guidelines (GL) are one of the initiatives undertaken by the European Banking Authority (EBA) to reduce unjustified variability of risk parameters and own funds requirements and are part of a broader review of the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) Approach that is carried out by the EBA in accordance with the plan outlined in the Report on the review of the IRB Approach published in February 20161. These GL are focused on the definitions and modelling techniques used in the estimation of risk parameters for both non-defaulted and defaulted exposures, whereas other regulatory products developed in the review process will clarify other aspects related to the application of the IRB Approach. The EBA considers these clarifications and harmonisation necessary to achieve comparability of risk parameters estimated on the basis of internal models, and to restore trust in these models by market participants while at the same time preserving risk sensitivity of capital requirements.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_94986: The EBA has in its previous work identified a clear need for these GL, including in five reports on the comparability and pro-cyclicality of capital requirements, developed in accordance with Article 502 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and published by the EBA in December 20132, in addition to subsequent benchmarking reports. These reports confirmed significant discrepancies in risk parameters and own funds requirements across institutions and jurisdictions, which did not reflect differences in risk profiles but resulted from different underlying definitions and certain modelling choices. These discrepancies were in part a consequence of excessive flexibility incorporated in the IRB framework and are considered to be a main driver in the loss of trust of internal models by observers, investors and other market participants.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_94987: With regard to non-defaulted exposures the draft GL provide detailed clarifications on the estimation of probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) parameters. In the case of defaulted exposures, institutions are required to estimate LGD (so called LGD in-default) and expected loss best estimate (ELBE). As these parameters are in fact part of LGD models, the clarifications on the estimation provided in the GL are based largely on the requirements specified for the estimation of LGD for non-defaulted exposures. In addition, the GL specify aspects common to all risk parameters, such as the use of human judgement both in the development and in the application of the internal models, appropriate margin of conservatism (MoC) that should be incorporated in risk parameters, and regular reviews of the models to ensure timely implementation of necessary changes in case of deteriorated performance of the models. The aim of the GL is therefore to harmonise the concepts and methods used today.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_94988: The goal of the GL is ultimately to reduce the unwarranted variability in capital requirements stemming from differences in model practices. For this purpose, the GL differentiate between model development and model calibration, as it has been important for the EBA to allow flexibility in terms

However, the calibration and the determination of capital requirements have to be identified in an objective manner. Consequently, the GL have put the highest emphasis on the requirements for model calibration. For instance, whereas the model development may exclude observations during the building of the model to obtain an accurate model, all loss observations have to be used for the calibration of the actual capital requirements.

PARAGRAPH_94995: As it is expected that these GL may lead to material changes in numerous rating systems used currently by institutions, sufficient time has to be granted for their implementation, which also takes into account the time needed to seek supervisory approval for material model changes. The proposed deadline for implementation is the end of 2020, based on the Opinion on the implementation of the review of the IRB Approach published by the EBA in February 20163. This Opinion describes the envisaged phasing-in approach and the specified deadline refers to implementation of all changes stemming from the regulatory review of the IRB Approach. It is expected, however, that institutions immediately initiate preparations to implement the GL.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_95001: Introduction

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_95002: The concept of the Internal Ratings Based (IRB) Approach for credit risk was first introduced by Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC of 14 June 2006 (known as the Capital Requirements Directive), later replaced by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (Capital Requirements Regulation - CRR) and Directive 2013/36/EU of 26 June 2013 (Capital Requirements Directive - CRD). The CRR introduced a number of mandates for the European Banking Authority (EBA) to develop technical standards and guidelines to supplement the basic legislation in order to ensure more harmonised application of the IRB requirements.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_95003: In this regard and in accordance with Article 502 of the CRR, the EBA published in December 2013 a set of five reports on the comparability and pro-cyclicality of capital requirements, presenting the results of a study conducted by the EBA on the comparability of risk estimates and capital requirements, including analysis of the factors that contribute to discrepancies among institutions. Based on the results, the EBA concluded that further guidance was needed, as current practices differed significantly across countries and institutions. Consequently, the EBA initiated work to provide further regulatory guidance, and these Guidelines on PD estimation, LGD estimation and the treatment of defaulted exposures (GL) are one of the resulting initiatives, specifically targeting the significant discrepancies identified in the methodologies underlying risk estimates.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_95004: The sources of discrepancies identified in the area of modelling were related mostly to different definitions of the main concepts underlying the risk parameters, and different modelling choices made possible by the large degree of flexibility incorporated in the IRB framework. In addition, different understanding of regulatory requirements was also observed.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_95005: These GL are therefore focused on aligning terminology and definitions, in particular in relation to metrics such as default rate or realised LGD, which are the basis for estimation of risk parameters. Furthermore, the GL provide clarification on the application of certain regulatory requirements which, until now, have been interpreted in various ways, and specify principles for the estimation of risk parameters, including those applicable to defaulted exposures. Although the GL may limit certain modelling choices, they are focused on the elements that lead to non-risk-based variability and intend to preserve sufficient flexibility to ensure risk sensitivity of the models. Therefore, the GL do not prescribe any specific estimation methodology, recognising that different approaches may be appropriate for different portfolios to reflect different risk profiles.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_95006: The main objective of the GL is to provide the rules that will lead to increased comparability of the model outcomes. Differences in risk parameters between institutions should ideally reflect differences in the underlying risk rather than different modelling choices. In addition, clearer rules in that regard will limit the possibility for regulatory arbitrage. Other aspects of the models that are not explicitly prescribed in the GL, such as the choice of risk drivers and estimation methodology, will

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_95011: As the GL are part of a broader review of the IRB Approach carried out by the EBA they do not address all identified sources of risk-weighted asset (RWA) variability. The GL focus on aspects related to modelling of parameters such as PD, LGD, best estimate of expected loss (ELBE) and LGD in- default, whereas other elements, including the definition of default on which these parameters should be based, rating processes, data quality processes and other aspects of the application of the IRB Approach, are addressed in other regulatory products. The regulatory products, developed as part of the regulatory review of the IRB Approach as outlined in the Report published in February 20164, will affect nearly all aspects of the IRB Approach and, as a consequence, it is expected that they will be able to significantly reduce unjustified RWA variability, which is deemed to stem from the lack of sufficiently specified requirements with regard to certain aspects of the IRB Approach. These GL provide such specifications, where necessary, to achieve the objective of a Single Rulebook, as well as to regain public trust in the use of internal models.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_95012: It has to be stressed that these GL include numerous references to the EBA draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on IRB assessment methodology5, which set conditions for competent authorities to assess the rating systems of institutions. As the RTS contain rules for competent authorities on their assessment of the IRB methodologies, they also provides details to institutions about how competent authorities are expected to understand and apply aspects of the CRR in the course of their assessment. Therefore, these GL and the RTS mentioned above should be read together, as many aspects related to modelling have already been clarified in the RTS, and in these cases the provisions are not repeated in the GL. When implementing any changes in the rating systems stemming from the regulatory review of the IRB Approach, and also subsequently on a continuous basis, institutions should take into account not only these GL but also provisions included in other related regulatory products, in particular in the RTS on IRB assessment methodology, the RTS on materiality threshold for past due credit obligations, the GL on the application of the definition of default, and the RTS on the nature, severity and duration of economic downturn.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_95013: As the RTS on the nature, severity and duration of economic downturn are still under development the requirements regarding the estimation of downturn LGD have not been included in the GL at this stage. Once the RTS have specified the identification of the downturn period the GL will be updated by adding a section clarifying how the impact of economic downturn should be reflected in the LGD estimates. In order not to pre-empt any decisions that will be taken when specifying the final RTS, it is considered appropriate that the RTS on the nature, severity and duration of economic downturn and the relevant section of the GL should be published together.

Regardless of these potential developments, the provisions included in these GL and other related regulatory products will continue to apply to these models and portfolios, which will remain within the scope of the IRB Approach.

PARAGRAPH_95023: The GL are focused on two of three main risk parameters underlying the IRB Approach, namely PD and LGD; conversion factors are not within the scope of these GL. The estimation of risk parameters is understood in a broad sense, encompassing all data, methods and processes leading to the estimates, including preparation of the necessary datasets, model development for the purpose of risk differentiation, and calibration that aims to arriving at risk parameters reflecting the long-run averages and, in the case of LGD, additional calibration step to take into account downturn conditions. As an LGD model encompasses not only LGD parameters applicable to non-defaulted exposures but also parameters such as LGD in-default and ELBE, all requirements for LGD are also applicable to LGD in-default and ELBE, unless specified otherwise in Chapter 7 of the GL. LGD in- default and ELBE are therefore defined through differences between them and the LGD for non- defaulted exposures. In addition to the requirements regarding the estimation of risk parameters, the GL address selected aspects of the application of risk parameters and the review of risk parameters.

PARAGRAPH_95037: Figure 1 presents the scope of the GL in graphical format. The first two steps, i.e. model development and calibration, including preparation of data for each of these steps, form the full process of the estimation of a risk parameter. To capture specific aspects of the estimation of various risk parameters, the requirements in this regard have been specified in the GL separately for PD, LGD and parameters for defaulted exposures, i.e. ELBE and LGD in-default.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_95038: Model development is understood in the GL as the part of the process of estimation of risk parameters that leads to appropriate risk differentiation, whereas calibration is the part of the estimation process that leads to appropriate risk quantification. These steps include preparation of various datasets for the purpose of model development and calibration. These datasets may be at least partly overlapping; however, it is not only the samples of data that may be different in each phase. The scope of necessary information, as well as requirements regarding data representativeness, are also different and hence will have to be assessed separately.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_95039: Of those two phases, the GL put more focus on calibration, leaving significantly greater flexibility for institutions in model development. This approach is related to the objective of the GL to contribute to increased comparability of the risk estimates and the resulting own funds requirements. For this purpose, the GL provide detailed definitions of the main concepts underlying risk quantification, such as default rate and long-run average default rate for PD and realised LGD and long-run average LGD for LGD quantification. At the same time, the GL intend to preserve the risk sensitivity of the IRB Approach, and hence more flexibility is given in the model development, with the intention that risk differentiation should be reflective of the institution's specific risk profile.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_95040: The three subsequent steps presented in the chart in grey, comprising internal independent validation, supervisory approval for the rating systems and their material changes, and implementation of the models in the IT systems and internal processes of the institution, are not within the scope of these GL. It is considered that sufficient clarifications in that regard have been provided in the RTS on IRB assessment methodology, and in Regulation (EU) No 529/2014 on the materiality of extensions and changes of the IRB Approach and the Advanced Measurement Approach.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_95041: Under step 6, the estimated risk parameter are applied by the institutions in the calculation of own funds requirements, as well as in internal risk management and decision making processes. The GL clarify only selected aspects of the application of the risk parameters, including additional conservatism in the application of risk parameters, the use of human judgement and overrides, and certain clarifications regarding the use of risk parameters. As the required areas of the use test have already been specified in the RTS on IRB assessment methodology, these GL only complement these requirements with the clarification on the possible deviations between the parameters used for the purpose of own funds requirements and those used in internal processes.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_95042: While the calculation of risk weights and risk-weighted exposure amounts based on risk parameters is not in the scope of the GL, additional clarification is provided on a specific regulatory area of use of the risk parameters, namely the calculation of IRB shortfall or excess based on the amount of expected loss, in accordance with Article 159 of the CRR. This section of the GL is also complementary to the requirements provided in the RTS on IRB assessment methodology.

PARAGRAPH_95046: Finally, the GL provide clarifications on the regular reviews of risk parameters, which is presented as step 7 on the chart, including the required scope of annual reviews. The additional arrows within the circle present actions that may be taken as a result of a review. The GL leave flexibility in that regard, and specify that the actions should be appropriate to the character and severity of the identified deficiencies. The appropriate actions could therefore entail redevelopment of the model, recalibration of risk parameters or additional analysis to be performed, for instance as an ad hoc validation.

PARAGRAPH_95047: Structure of the rating systems

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:9] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_95048: Rating systems should be developed for specific types of exposures, i.e. groups of exposures that are homogeneously managed in accordance with the definition included in Article 142(1) of the CRR. The type of exposures for which the rating system is developed form the range of application of a rating system. A rating system encompasses a PD model and an LGD model (or regulatory LGDs in case an institution does not use own estimates of LGD), and any other credit risk assessment methods, including in particular conversion factors. The scope of application of a PD or LGD model may be different from the range of application of a rating system, as long as exposures covered by the rating system are assigned to a common obligor and facility rating scales.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:9]
PARAGRAPH_95049: A PD model may entail various ranking methods. A common example of such a combination may be an application or customer scorecard and a behavioural scorecard for retail exposures, where the use of a given scorecard may depend on, among others, the availability of the necessary input data. Furthermore, the calibration of either PD or LGD may be performed separately for different calibration segments. This may be necessary where the scope of application of a PD or LGD model includes portfolios of exposures which carry significantly different level of risk, for instance because of different geographical locations. The scope of application of a given ranking method may not be aligned with the scope of application of a calibration segment. Where a calibration segment includes obligors or exposures that are subject to different ranking methods, the scores resulting from these methods should be normalised to perform a meaningful calibration. The relations between these different notions are presented in a schematic manner in Figure 2.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:10]
PARAGRAPH_95071: " calibration - for the purpose of risk quantification.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:10]
PARAGRAPH_95072: Both phases start with the preparation of an appropriate set of data and the verification of the quality of data. However, the scope of data and the assessment of representativeness are different in each phase. In principle, data used for model development is a selection of an appropriate sample which is highly representative of the application portfolio, and hence provides the best basis for effective risk differentiation. This sample should contain information on all relevant risk drivers. On the other hand, the data used for calculating long-run average default rate or LGD for the purpose of calibration has to contain all observations from the relevant historical observation period. In this case, the lack of sufficient representativeness cannot provide the basis for excluding the data from the calculation. Instead, any identified issues are assessed from the perspective of their influence on risk quantification and, if a bias in risk quantification is identified, it has to be addressed through an appropriate adjustment and margin of conservatism (MoC).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:10]
PARAGRAPH_95073: Once the appropriate data sample has been prepared the phase of model development consists of finding the relevant risk drivers and using them, on the basis of a chosen methodology, to rank or differentiate the obligors or exposures to grades or pools, according to the level of risk. In the case of LGD, this includes in particular analysis of the available collaterals. Institutions may use various methodologies, and they may in particular combine different ranking methods under one PD model. Depending on the model design, the phase of model development may also entail estimation of intermediate risk parameters. This is a common approach in particular in the case of LGD models, where the design of the model may include components such as cure rate, work-out recovery rate, etc. These components would in this case be referred to as intermediate parameters subject to separate estimation in the phase of model development.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:10]
PARAGRAPH_95074: The phase of calibration has an objective of assigning adequate levels of risk parameters to grades or pools, or, in the case of direct estimates on a continuous rating scale, to individual obligors or exposures. The adequate levels of PD should be reflective of the long-run average default rate, whereas adequate levels of LGD should be the higher of the LGD based on the long-run average LGD and the LGD reflective of the downturn conditions. In practice, this is often achieved by applying a downturn adjustment to the estimate based on the long-run average LGD. In some cases, the calibration phase may include the design of grades or pools; this may be the case in particular where a master scale with fixed parameters is used. Under this methodology, the phase of model development is focused only on the ranking of obligors or exposures, and the boundaries of the grades are defined only in the phase of calibration based on the predefined levels of the risk parameters.

PARAGRAPH_95155: As the PD calibration is based on the long-run average default rate, this phase entails calculation of measures such as one-year default rates, observed average default rate and long-run average default rate. While the observed average default rate is based on all available one-year default rates, the long-run average default rate should reflect the likely range of variability of default rates and hence may be based on a different observation period, or may require certain adequate adjustments. In the case of LGD the calibration phase includes the calculation of realised LGD, for each defaulted observation, the observed average LGD based on all closed defaulted observations and the long-run average LGD, which also includes incomplete recovery processes.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:12]
PARAGRAPH_95156: Calibration has the purpose of ensuring that the estimates are reflective of the long-run average at a grade or pool level. This may be achieved either by providing the grades and pools retrospectively over the whole historical observation period and subsequently estimating long-run averages by grades or pools, or - where, for example, data or resources are not available to ensure reliable ratings for the whole historical observation period - by estimating the long-run average at the level of the calibration segment. Where direct estimates are used and where default rates per grade or pool may not be well defined for lack of individual grades, the latter method should be used. For LGD and LGD in-default, institutions also have to consider downturn conditions and use the estimates reflective of downturn conditions if these are more conservative than those based on the long-run average LGD. For ELBE the additional calibration step is related to the consideration of current economic circumstances.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:12]
PARAGRAPH_95157: The aspects specified in the GL and presented in the grey boxes in Figure 3 are applicable to both phases of model development and calibration. This includes in particular the governance around the representativeness of data, including specification of adequate policies and the use of human judgement, which may be necessary at any stage of the estimation process. Another overarching aspect is MoC. Although MoC is expected to be added to the best estimate of the risk parameter, i.e. after the calibration phase, it should cover any deficiencies of data or methods that may be identified at any stage of the estimation process that may bias risk quantification.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:12] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_95158: Finally, for risk parameters for defaulted exposures, all requirements specified for LGD in Chapter 6 apply, unless explicitly specified otherwise. A major aspect which differentiates ELBE and LGD in- default from LGD for non-defaulted exposures is the concept of reference dates, which have to be taken into account both in model development and in calibration, given that the calibration has to be performed separately for each reference date. Furthermore, specific requirements regarding calibration apply in particular to ELBE, which has to reflect current economic circumstances rather than downturn conditions; also in this case institutions may explore certain relations between ELBE and specific credit risk adjustments used for accounting purposes.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:12]
PARAGRAPH_95159: It has to be noted that although the structure of the GL differentiates the stages of model development and calibration, the steps taken by institutions in the estimation of risk parameters do not have to be taken in the same order as that presented in the GL. These GL do not require any particular sequence of actions, but rather set out the requirements related to certain steps of the process. It is therefore possible, for instance, that one-year default rates are calculated in the stage of model development if this is necessary for the purpose of appropriate risk differentiation.

PARAGRAPH_95163: In addition, the final chapters of the GL specify selected aspects related to the application and review of risk parameters. In the application of risk parameters, i.e. in assigning current obligors or exposures to adequate grades or pools and allocating to them an adequate level or risk parameters, it may be necessary to apply an override or additional conservatism (which should not be confused with MoC quantified in the estimation of risk parameters). This additional conservatism is usually obligor or exposure specific, and may be related in particular to the diminished quality of data used in application of the risk parameter. Instead, an override would typically be appropriate if there are individual circumstances, related to a given obligor or exposures, which the model reasonably cannot take into account. Such adjusted risk parameters are then used for the purpose of calculating own funds requirements, for internal purposes and for the calculation of IRB shortfall or excess, which influences the level of own funds included in the calculation of capital adequacy ratio.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:13] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_95164: Finally, the risk parameters have to be regularly reviewed to ensure that adequate estimates are used both for own funds requirements calculation and for internal purposes. Where, as a result of such review, institutions identify a need to change the model, such changes should be implemented in accordance with the requirements specified for the estimation of risk parameters. The life cycle of a model is presented in a schematic manner in Figure 1.

PARAGRAPH_95170: These GL apply to all models for which an institution received permission to use under the IRB Approach. Where institutions do not use own estimates of LGD (in accordance with the 'Foundation' IRB Approach) Chapters 6 and 7 do not apply, but all other requirements, including those specified in Chapters 4, 5, 8 and 9, apply with regard to PD estimates. The applicable requirements are expected to be assessed by the competent authorities within the process of granting initial permission to use the IRB Approach, assessment of material changes to the rating systems in accordance with Article 143(3) of the CRR, or ongoing reviews of the use of the IRB Approach.

PARAGRAPH_95171: The definitions specified in this section are used throughout the GL. The terms 'PD model' and 'LGD model' have been defined in a broad manner, referring to all data and methods related to both risk differentiation and risk quantification. In the case of LGD models, it has to be noted that the definition encompasses not only the data and methods used to derive LGD estimates for non- defaulted exposures, but also the risk parameters applicable to defaulted exposures such as ELBE and

PARAGRAPH_95178: The date of application of these GL is set consistently as for all other regulatory products developed as part of the EBA's regulatory review of the IRB Approach. The implementation date is relatively distant, as it is expected that the implementation of these products, including these GL, will lead to material changes in many rating systems currently in use. To facilitate the implementation process as well as the assessment and approval of these changes by competent authorities, for instance by including multiple aspects in one change request, the implementation deadline is the same for all required changes. To ensure sufficient time for supervisory assessment and implementation within the deadline, institutions should agree with their competent authorities the latest date for submitting the application for the necessary changes in the rating systems.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:14]
PARAGRAPH_95181: The segmentation principles aim to provide guidance on the highest level of rating system design. These principles are particularly relevant to changes in the range of application of certain rating systems, for example where an existing rating system is rolled out to an acquired portfolio, or a portfolio that is otherwise not yet treated under the IRB Approach. Among other things, the GL require in this regard the availability of fundamentally comparable credit-related information, meaning that, with respect to the obligors or exposures to which the rating system is extended, the relevant information has a similar nature and is available for the purpose of rating assignment, or is at least possible to obtain. For instance, as the information available for business clients and for natural persons is fundamentally different, these should not be covered by the same rating system.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:14]
PARAGRAPH_95182: A rating system is a broad concept which includes both PD and LGD models. Obligors and exposures covered by a rating system should be homogeneously managed, including in particular the use of common obligor and facility rating scales. Although a rating system may comprise more than one PD and LGD model, and although these models may comprise multiple calibration segments, the results of all calibrations within a rating system have to be reflected in the single obligor rating scale and a single facility rating scale applicable within the rating system. It is also crucial that the definition of default is used identically for the purpose of calibration of all models within a rating system.

PARAGRAPH_95187: Good quality of data is a fundamental condition for developing a robust rating system. The data requirements in this general part apply to model development, risk quantification and application of all risk parameters and contain clarifications regarding the assessment of accuracy, completeness and appropriateness of data. More detailed requirements, especially regarding the scope of required data specific to PD or LGD estimation, and to LGD-in-default or ELBE estimation, are described within the relevant chapters of these GL.

PARAGRAPH_95188: Representativeness of data

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:15]
PARAGRAPH_95189: Representativeness of data may influence the accuracy of the estimates; where the underlying historical data is less representative of the current portfolio the estimates may be less adequate. To ensure good performance of the models and their good predictive power, institutions should have adequate policies, processes and methods for assessing the representativeness of data used for the purpose of estimation of risk parameters, and they should pay particular attention to situations where data from different sources are used. While the methods of assessment may in some cases differ for data from different sources, especially because of the structure and availability of information, the applied standards should be the same for all data used in the estimation process.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:15]
PARAGRAPH_95190: The dimensions of representativeness specified in the GL include the scope of application of the model, definition of default, distribution of the relevant risk drivers, current and foreseeable economic and market conditions, and lending standards and recovery policies. The requirements for data representativeness are split into two sub-sections, namely requirements for data used in model development and for data used in calibration of risk parameters (i.e. for the data used to calculate the long-run average default rate and the long-run average LGD). This split is consistent with the structure of the CRR, where data requirements regarding model development are treated in sub- section 1 of Section 6 in Chapter 3 of Part Three, Title II of the CRR, and data requirements for risk quantification (calibration) are treated in sub-section 2 of the same section. This split has also been consistently followed in Chapters 7 and 8 of the RTS on IRB assessment methodology respectively.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:15]
PARAGRAPH_95191: The data requirements for risk differentiation and risk quantification differ both in terms of the methods for analysis and with regard to required actions where the analysis reveals insufficient data representativeness. In particular, for the purpose of model development, institutions may, subject to certain requirements, use a definition of default other than that specified in Article 178 of the CRR. However, they should closely analyse the ranges and distributions of key risk characteristics within the historical observations as compared with the current portfolio, because, for the purpose of model development, material observed differences in these characteristics should be avoided by selecting an appropriate sample of data, for instance by using a shorter observation period. On the other hand, for the purpose of calculating long-run average default rate and long-run average LGD, the definition of default has to strictly reflect the requirements of Article 178 of the CRR, whereas the comparability of the ranges of the key risk characteristics is necessary only to a required degree. Furthermore, requirements regarding the representativeness of current and foreseeable market and economic conditions are included only for data used in calibration, and are related to the requirements for estimating long-run average default rate for PD models, and long-run average LGD as well as downturn considerations for LGD.

PARAGRAPH_95195: The steps that should be taken where significant non-representativeness of data is identified are also different in terms of model development and calibration. Whereas in model development non- representativeness is normally addressed by the adequate choice of a sample, the non-comparability of the historical data underlying risk quantification should not lead to any data exclusions, but should trigger an appropriate adjustment and increased MoC. The same principle should be followed where adjustments to the observed average default rate are necessary to meet the requirements laid down in Section 5.4. Thus data exclusions may be a tool to quantify adjustments to the observed average default and loss rates where these are necessary; however, they should never be taken into account for the purpose of calculating the observed average default rate.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:16]
PARAGRAPH_95196: The principles described above also apply to the specific case of the disposal of the portfolio of non- performing exposures and to the way these cases are reflected in the LGD estimation. This means that, while all defaulted observations, including those subject to the sale, have to be included in the calculation of long-run average LGD for the purpose of LGD calibration, institutions may decide not to include these observations in the sample used for the purpose of risk differentiation, for instance in the design of relevant pools. As specified in the GL, the LGD estimation methodology should be consistent with the collection and recovery policies adopted by the institution and adequate to the type of exposures to which LGDs are applied. One of the possible risk estimation methods includes specification of possible recovery scenarios and their probabilities, where the probability of each scenario would be a component of the model and would be determined taking into account relevant risk drivers, which may influence the frequency of use of a certain scenario. Another possibility would be to discard (some of) the default observations of sold credit obligations in the model development, whereas all default observations, including those related to sold credit obligations, should be included directly in the LGD calibration. In other words, where (some of) the observations subject to the sale would not be included in the phase of model development, they should provide the basis for the adequate adjustment in the calibration phase in order to reflect the calibration target, i.e. the long-run average LGD, which should always be based on all observed defaults.

PARAGRAPH_95198: Development of a robust rating system cannot be a purely statistical process, but to some extent also has to involve human judgement, to make sure that the models are appropriate for current and foreseeable portfolios and conditions, and that the models are acceptable for business users. Expert judgement may be necessary in particular with respect to the verification of model assumptions, and whether or not these are in line with economic expectations, to the design of the model, to the choice of risk drivers, etc. However, to ensure high quality of the models, expert judgement has to be appropriately documented and justified. This way, the judgemental elements of the model can be appropriately challenged and verified both by the validation function and by competent authorities. Therefore, this part of the GL clarifies the requirements regarding human judgement, including its documentation, in the estimation of risk parameters.

Within category B, institutions should also consider whether or not any changes in legal environment may lead to changes in default or loss rates, in particular changes to bankruptcy law and any regulations related to legal collection processes. However, this does not refer to changes in legal regulations on internal models or definition of default. Any data deficiencies related to the definition of default or any weaknesses in methods used in internal models should be classified under category A. Categories A and B are expected to be non-overlapping, i.e. each identified deficiency should be classified in only one of the categories.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:17]
PARAGRAPH_95205: The same rules should also be applied to any deficiencies related to the representativeness of data. The classification will therefore depend on the nature of the identified deficiency. Any missing data, including missing information on certain risk drivers in historical observations should be classified under category A. However, any changes in the distribution of risk characteristics in the application portfolio due to, for instance, changes in the underwriting standards, will be classified under category B.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:17] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_95206: As a general principle, institutions are required to address the identified deficiencies via appropriate adjustments and MoC. As an example, adjusting the data where deficiencies have been identified may involve rectifying the identified errors, for instance where missing data points are filled in with the most probable information, or the inaccuracies in data are corrected. Appropriate adjustment in the case of changes in the underwriting standards may take the form of an adequate shift of the estimated risk parameters. In any case, the objective of the appropriate adjustment is to achieve the most accurate estimates possible. To avoid excessive use of adjustments, institutions should be able to demonstrate that this objective has actually been achieved by a certain adjustment. They should also document any adjustments that have been applied, and regularly monitor their adequacy.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:17]
PARAGRAPH_95207: MoC should be applied on top of the best estimate of the risk parameter (i.e. a parameter after applying all appropriate adjustments). This also applies to situations where a predefined master scale is used; in this case, MoC is applied on top of the parameters defined in the master scale. While for internal purposes institutions may use best estimates of risk parameters if this is more appropriate, for own funds requirements calculation the final risk parameters, including MoC, should be taken into account.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:17]
PARAGRAPH_95208: MoC should be quantified for all deficiencies that could not be rectified by appropriate adjustment. However, even if the appropriate adjustment has been applied, the estimates are subject to additional uncertainty resulting from the application of the adjustments and its potential inaccuracy. Institutions should quantify MoC related to the identified deficiencies in the same categories used to classify deficiencies (categories A and B). In addition, they should quantify a general estimation error and present it in a separate category (category C). In future, this categorisation will help increase transparency with regard to the levels and underlying reasons for MoC.

The reference to statistical variance has been avoided in order to not impose a fixed methodology, which might for example lead to disproportionate MoC for low default portfolios.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:18]
PARAGRAPH_95214: The GL require that the final MoC to be added to the best estimate of the risk parameter be the sum of MoC for categories A, B and C. This proposal is based on an expectation that the categories will in general be non-overlapping. Nevertheless, the assumption of independence between MoC related to these categories would not be correct, as the appropriate adjustments which are made in relation to deficiencies stemming from categories A and B may influence the general estimation error. Therefore, for the purpose of harmonisation and in order not to impose over sophistication, it has been decided to require the aggregation of MoC between the categories based on a simple sum. However, different aggregation techniques may be used within each of the categories. Here, flexibility is left for the institutions to address in an adequate manner different types of deficiencies and their potential interrelations. All methods used for quantification and aggregation of MoC should be documented and regularly monitored.

PARAGRAPH_95216: Assume a change in regulatory requirements regarding the materiality threshold for detecting defaults triggered by the 90 days past due criterion. Assume the institution under consideration has stored the information regarding outstanding exposures monthly rather than daily. Thus the date of default and the exposure value cannot be retrieved historically. Even though some calculations could be made based on the monthly data, the 90 days may have been reached during a particular month and the default may not be visible based on monthly data. Therefore the institution has decided to set up a parallel default detection according to the new trigger, and to estimate MoC starting from the difference of the amount of defaults detected according to the old trigger and the new trigger.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:18]
PARAGRAPH_95217: An appropriate adjustment could be derived as follows: calculating the relative change in the number of defaults triggered according to the old and the new 90 days past due criterion compared with all defaults (i.e. taking into account all triggers) on a monthly basis. Thus an average correction factor can be estimated and applied retrospectively. As a result, the number of defaults according to the new 90 days past due trigger can be estimated for the available historical data.

PARAGRAPH_95225: It is clarified that each natural or legal person that has exposures within the scope of the IRB Approach should be rated including where there is unfunded credit protection. The rationale for this is that, for the purpose of model development, risk quantification and validation the assignment to a pool or grade after the application of unfunded credit protection would bias risk differentiation and default rate calculation. Even in the case of a rating transfer from a third party to the obligor, therefore, the initial rating of the obligor without taking into account the support of a third party should be available.

PARAGRAPH_95228: The data requirements for building the model for assigning exposures or obligors to grades or pools clarify that the reference points in time at which risk drivers are evaluated for the purpose of developing the model should be considered taking into account the dynamics and the update frequency of the information in question. The rationale for this is to avoid unjustified burden as well as to avoid biases in analysis due to autocorrelation. For example, obligor characteristics might be fairly static over time, whereas financial data from balance sheets is usually updated annually.

PARAGRAPH_95230: The GL clarify that the selection of certain risk drivers and rating criteria should be based not only on statistical analysis, but that the relevant business experts should be consulted on the business rationale and risk contribution of the risk drivers under consideration. The background of this requirement is to ensure that the proper risk drivers and rating criteria are taken into account in the model.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:19]
PARAGRAPH_95231: An additional characteristic that should be considered as a potential risk driver is the number of loans of the same type of facility that have been granted to an obligor. In particular, where an institution chooses for its retail portfolios to assign PDs at exposure level and to identify default at facility level, it should be ensured that the PDs are adequate for PD estimates by obligor grade or pool, as required in Article 180(1)(a) and 180(2)(a) of the CRR. The rationale is that, in the latter case, the underlying one-year default rates in a grade or pool may vary significantly if based on largely one-to-one or one- to-x relations (where one-to-x relations reflect obligors carrying multiple (x) facilities of the same type in a certain grade or pool). However, if the number of loans of the same type of facility which have been granted to one obligor does not constitute a risk driver, there may as well be no difference in risk.

PARAGRAPH_95236: is that the loss of information value over time with respect to certain risk drivers or rating criteria, and in particular information which stems from the credit application and which is usually not updated during the life time of the credit products under consideration, leads to increased uncertainty, which should be appropriately reflected in the design of grades and pools, and the corresponding PD estimates.

PARAGRAPH_95237: The last requirement specified in the GL with respect to risk drivers and rating criteria relevant for PD estimation is that risk drivers and rating criteria should be used consistently with respect to the relevant time horizon in model development, model calibration and model application. This is because any inconsistency in the time horizons could lead to significant bias in the resulting PD estimates. If, for example, an institution considers days-past-due buckets as pools in its rating model, it nevertheless has to ensure that the ranking model for the pool of obligors without any past due obligations provides PD estimates appropriate for a one-year time horizon, as this is the relevant time horizon for the application portfolio.

PARAGRAPH_95239: Regarding the use of third party ratings in obligors' PD estimates, the GL specify the principles for the use of third party internal or external ratings in the estimates of the PD of an obligor. It is clarified that institutions may use an internal rating of a guarantor instead of a rating of an obligor for the purposes of own funds requirements calculation where there is no difference in risk between the relevant obligor or exposure and the relevant third party, given the existence of explicit guarantees (this is referred to as a rating transfer). Furthermore, the rating of a related third party may be taken into account as a risk driver or rating criterion in the ranking method, to reflect the support from a third party to the obligor. Finally, the third party's rating may be considered for the purpose of overriding the assignment of an obligor to a pool or grade provided by a ranking method.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:20]
PARAGRAPH_95240: Among the important aspects clarified in this chapter is the provision that the considered obligor or exposure in whose PD estimate the third party rating is considered should remain in its exposure class. Even where the PD of the obligor is fully substituted by the PD of the third party because there is no difference in risk, the exposure should remain in the exposure class applicable to the obligor. Moreover, it is required that any changes to the rating of the third party should be reflected in the PD estimate incorporating the third party rating in a timely manner.

To achieve that objective, the GL allow institutions to decide on the philosophy underlying the grade or pool assignment and the risk drivers, but require that a number of criteria be taken into account, including, among others, that institutions need to monitor their choice of rating philosophy, to apply that philosophy consistently over time, to understand its impact on the dynamics and volatility of capital requirements, and to take the rating philosophy into account for back-testing purposes.

PARAGRAPH_95253: For the data for calculating default rates to be complete, it has to include the criteria to identify the relevant type of exposures covered by the rating system in. The rationale for this is that the institution should take into account all defaults with respect to the relevant type of exposures, independently of the existence of a rating assignment. Moreover, data covering the risk drivers and rating criteria need to be available for the purpose of calculating default rates per grade and pool. Where relevant risk drivers or rating criteria are missing, for example because the relevant information has not been collected from the obligors in the past, institutions should apply appropriate adjustments and increase MoC. Moreover, banks should make efforts to minimise the proportion of missing data over time. The rationale for this is that the missing information increases uncertainty around the default rates per grade in the past, so institutions should ensure that obligors or exposures are appropriately assigned to grades and pools, taking into account the identified risk drivers and rating criteria.

The rationale is to ensure accurate measurement of one-year default rates, as an obligor can also default if there is no repayment obligation during the observation period, for example because of bankruptcy filing. Moreover, it should be noted that guarantors which do not carry a credit obligation are excluded from this specification of one-year default rate calculation6, as by definition they cannot be subject to the same default identification process as the institution's obligors. However, the information stemming from defaults of guarantors or any other relevant data on external default rates should be taken into account in the estimation of the long-run average default rates if this is necessary to meet the requirements in Section 5.3.4. Where obligors whose obligations stem solely from non-credit products fall under the scope of application of the relevant model and are treated in accordance with the institution's internal default definition, these should form a separate calibration segment in the rating system, in order not to bias the default rate of obligors with credit facilities. Similarly, with regard to obligors or facilities only with committed but undrawn credit lines, these might have to be treated in a separate calibration segment in the rating system, to avoid lowering unduly the default rate of obligors with drawn credit lines.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:22]
PARAGRAPH_95262: It is clarified that, for the purpose of calculation of the one-year default rate by grade or pool, institutions should refer to the obligors assigned to grades or pools at the beginning of the one-year observation period, where the assignment to a grade may be based on an override. However, where the assignment to a grade is the effect of a rating transfer from a provider of unfunded credit protection, the obligor and potential default should be taken into account with respect to the grade to which the obligor was assigned before the rating transfer. The rationale for this is that the default rate of lower rating grades would be biased if the defaults of those obligors that received credit protection were not taken into account for the respective default rate calculation. The same rationale holds true for the requirement that ex post conservative adjustments should not be taken into account for the purpose of one-year default rate calculations, as obligors that are downgraded for the purpose of capital requirements calculation, for example because of a missing re-rating, could unduly lower the default rate of the resulting (worse) grade.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:22]
PARAGRAPH_95263: Finally, and with respect to one-year default rate calculation, it is clarified that all obligors carrying a credit obligation at the beginning of the observation period should be included in the denominator and, if applicable, the numerator of the default rate, calculated for the grade the obligor has been assigned to at the beginning of the observation period This also holds true where obligors migrated to a different grade or pool, or to a different rating system, during the observation period, and also where the credit obligation was sold, written off, repaid or otherwise closed during the observation period. The rationale for this is to achieve a harmonised and well-defined notion of one-year default rate. However, in case of concerns that the inclusion of these obligors could lead to a biased observed average default rate, for example because of a missing information on the rating at the beginning of the observation period, appropriate adjustments may be applied and MoC should be added to the best estimate of the risk parameter.

The rationale for the required analysis is to ensure that institutions are aware of the impact of the chosen calculation method and of fast-growing or shrinking portfolios on the observed average default rate and that they apply appropriate adjustments and MoC where necessary. Moreover, it is clarified that the observed average of one-year default rates should be calculated as the arithmetic average of all one-year default rates, except for retail portfolios, where the observed average default rate may be calculated as a weighted average of one-year default rates if more recent data is a better predictor of losses.

PARAGRAPH_95271: Regarding the long-run average default rate, the GL clarify that this should be calculated as the average of observed one-year default rates if the historical observation period is representative of the likely range of variability of one-year default rates and, in particular, if the historical observation period contains an appropriate mix of good and bad years. If the one-year default rates are not representative of the likely range of variability, institutions should estimate the long-run average default rate by estimating an appropriate adjustment to the average of observed one-year default rates.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:23]
PARAGRAPH_95272: For the purpose of clarity the existence, lack or prevalence of bad years should be considered with respect to economic indicators which are relevant for the considered type of exposure. In particular it is clarified that, where bad years are over-represented in the historical observation period, institutions may consider downward adjustments of the observed average of default rates, based on an appropriate method taking into account the correlation between economic indicators relevant for the considered portfolio and the underlying observed default rates.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:23]
PARAGRAPH_95273: To limit possible variability stemming from the application of downward adjustments, a benchmark is proposed, namely the maximum of the average of one-year default rates over the most recent five years and the average of one-year default rates over the whole available observation period. Institutions may still estimate long-run average default rates below this benchmark, but this should be duly justified and eventually trigger additional MoC.

PARAGRAPH_95275: The process of PD calibration is performed on a calibration sample, namely the sample to which the ranking or scoring method is applied to assign the long-run average default rate estimates to the grades and pools provided by the ranking or scoring method. One of the issues clarified in this context is that the calibration sample should be comparable to the current portfolio in terms of obligor and transaction characteristics, but should reflect at the same time the likely range of variability of default rates.

PARAGRAPH_95280: process and methodology an institution has chosen in that regard. The objectives behind the chosen calibration and re-calibration process and methodology, including the design of the calibration sample, can be referred to as calibration philosophy. The extent to which capital requirements are sensitive to changes in the economic environment depends on both the rating as well as the calibration philosophy.

PARAGRAPH_95281: Institutions that have a ranking method in place which is very sensitive to macroeconomic conditions, reflecting point-in-time (PIT) rating philosophy but also aiming to obtain more stable through-the-cycle (TTC) PD estimates in their calibration and recalibration process (to ensure a certain degree of stability of capital requirements over the credit cycle), might show the same cyclicality of capital requirements as institutions that incorporate risk drivers less sensitive to the economic environment into their ranking method. The extent to which calibration influences the sensitivity of PD estimates to the economic environment depends in particular on:

PARAGRAPH_95284: Table 1 outlines various combinations of rating and calibration philosophy including an indication of whether or not such combinations would be compliant with the requirements set out in these GL and other relevant regulations (i.e. the CRR and the RTS on IRB assessment methodology). For example, if the grades or pools of a model were based predominantly on risk drivers that are insensitive to economic conditions (such as the obligors jurisdiction or sector), thus constituting a TTC rating philosophy, and at the same time the PD estimates were based on the last available ('current') one- year default rate ('PIT A') these estimates would not be applicable for the purpose of own funds requirements calculation. This is because the requirements of Section 5.3.4 of these GL would not be met. For the same reason, a ranking or scoring method reflecting a PIT rating philosophy where the PD estimates by grade or pool were based on the current default rate ('PIT B') would not be compliant with the relevant requirements for the IRB Approach.

PARAGRAPH_95285: On the other hand, with a model based on a TTC rating philosophy where the PD estimates per grade or pool reflect long-run average default rates ('TTC A'), the resulting PD estimates may be applicable for own funds requirements calculation if all other requirements are met, in particular those set out in Articles 170(4) and 179(1)(a) of the CRR, where the incorporation of all relevant information (including, for example, on delinquency) is required.

PARAGRAPH_95286: An institution might use a more complex combination, for example by using risk drivers that are quite sensitive to economic conditions in a statistical default prediction model providing PD estimates for individual obligors, (i.e. a PIT rating philosophy), but applying a two-step approach for the purpose of calibration, namely by evaluating these PD estimates on a more recent point in time and subsequently adjusting them such that the average of these estimates reflects the long-run average default rate at the level of the relevant calibration segment (or even portfolio - if there is only one calibration segment). This would be an example of a 'TTC B' calibration, as indicated in Table 1, and would be applicable for own funds requirements calculation if all other requirements are met, in particular those on the calibration sample (the chosen point in time would need to reflect a sample

PARAGRAPH_95291: The difference between calibration approaches 'TTC B' and 'TTC C' in Table 1 is that, for the latter, the calibration sample would consist of multiple points in time covering the whole historical observation period. Another example would be if an institution estimates PDs per grade but is able to assess these grades historically for only a part of the historical observation period ('TTC D'); for example, it might not be possible to assess retrospectively the correct grades for all obligors over the whole observation period. In this case, the ranking method would require expert-based qualitative assessments, and experts would need to historically review every rating of every obligor subject to the ranking method within the historical observation period. The PD estimates based on the available grades and pools would be adjusted to reflect a long-run average default rate of the relevant pool, covering the whole historical observation period.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:25]
PARAGRAPH_95292: Finally, the approach 'TTC E' reflects an example where the grades and pools are evaluated on only one or a few points in time, and the PD estimation of a grade or pool incorporates the use of migration matrices for the purpose of estimating long-run average default rates covering the full historical observation period.

PARAGRAPH_95321: For the purpose of aligning terminology, the GL define calibration in relation to PD estimation as the process of ensuring that the PDs assigned to grades or pools reflect the long-run average default rate at the level relevant to the applied calibration method.

PARAGRAPH_95322: For the avoidance of doubt, it is clarified that where banks apply scoring models and specify score intervals representative of a common level of risk, and where obligors or exposures whose scores fall into such an interval receive the same PD estimate, this process may be considered part of the calibration.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:26]
PARAGRAPH_95323: Moreover, the GL provide an overview of the calibration methods mentioned in the CRR, and state to which type of exposures, for instance retail, non-retail or purchased receivables, they are applicable. In addition, the GL clarify that each calibration method may consider the long-run average default rate at the level of the calibration segment, or at grade or pool level. Where there is only one calibration segment in a portfolio, calibration at the level of the calibration segment corresponds to calibration at portfolio level. To incentivise understanding and awareness of these different levels of calibration, and to limit RWA variability stemming from these choices, the GL require that institutions perform additional calibration tests at the level of the calibration segment where calibration is performed at the grade or pool level, and vice versa. For portfolio calibration, where the grades or pools are not available, this additional calibration test would require grouping of ranked exposures into artificial grades to allow performing the calibration test at the level of these grades. For this purpose, the grouping may be the same as for back-testing.

PARAGRAPH_95324: Regardless of the chosen level of calibration the objective is to obtain PDs at grade level that are representative of the long-run average default rate. In this sense, the portfolio level calibration is a method to obtain this long-run average default rate at a grade level, for instance where institutions do not have information at grade level for the whole historical observation period. It could therefore be seen as a two-step calibration, i.e. the first step would be to obtain the portfolio default rate representative of the long-run average, and the second step would be to derive the PDs at grade level.

PARAGRAPH_95331: Furthermore, these GL contain a definition of the calibration sample, which is defined as the data set on which the PD estimates are evaluated to perform the calibration. This notion is introduced because the GL refer to this data set and require that institutions find an appropriate balance between the calibration sample being comparable to the current portfolio, in terms of obligor and transaction characteristics, and it reflecting the likely range of variability of default rates.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:27] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_95332: Another important aspect that is clarified with respect to calibration is that calibration should be performed before the application of MoC and floors on PD, as required by Articles 160(1) and 163(1) of the CRR (PD floors), and after taking overrides into account. The rationale for this is that the application of MoC or PD floors in the calibration could lead to significant underestimation of final PD estimates of a grade or pool. For example, where an institution estimates PDs as simple averages of default probability estimates in a given grade in accordance with Article 180(1)(g) of the CRR, a group of obligors with significantly different levels of default risk could be grouped into one grade or pool if MoC or PD floors were applied before calibration. It should be noted that this provision clarifies that, even where a bank has a current portfolio fully representative of the historic portfolio and of the likely range of default rates, and where the calibration sample therefore corresponds to the current portfolio, it is still expected that the final PD estimate is higher than the average of default risk probabilities due to MoC and PD floors. Moreover, overrides should be taken into account to the extent relevant and observed for the ranking method underlying the grades and pools for which the calibration is performed.

PARAGRAPH_95333: The GL acknowledge that, regarding the policy on rating philosophy and calibration outlined above, there is a wide range of practices. However, the distinction between model development (leading to risk differentiation) and calibration, including estimation of long-run average default rates (leading to risk quantification), should not prohibit institutions from using methods where some aspects of both stages are combined.

In this context, workout LGD based on the institution's experience in terms of recovery processes and losses is considered to be the main, superior methodology that should be used by institutions. It is essential that LGD estimates be based on the institutions' own loss and recovery experience, to ensure that estimates are adequate for the institutions' portfolios and policies, and in particular that they are consistent with recovery processes. Therefore, although internal experience may be supplemented with external data, institutions should not use methodologies that are based only on external data, such as so called market LGD and market-

PARAGRAPH_95342: An alternative methodology that is available for retail exposures and purchased corporate receivables is that of deriving LGD estimates from realised losses and appropriate estimates of PD. However, in this case too, institutions should ensure that the estimates are sufficiently robust. This is ensured where both realised losses and PD estimates meet all relevant requirements. In particular, to ensure comparability of LGD estimates based on this methodology with other LGD estimates, the calculation of total losses has to be consistent with the concept of economic loss used for the purpose of workout LGD.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:28] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_95343: In accordance with point (b) of Article 52 of the RTS on IRB assessment methodology, and to achieve correct LGD estimates, institutions should assess whether two defaults related to the same exposure are independent. The less time between defaults, the less likely it is that the default events were independent. In particular, it was specified that institutions cannot consider a new default on an exposure, occurring within nine months from the return to non-defaulted status, independent from with the first default. For the purpose of LGD estimation, they should treat this situation as if the exposure was constantly defaulted from the first moment when default occurred. These nine months should not be confused with the probation period defined in the EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default, which ensures a prudent ongoing management of defaulted exposures. The minimum independence period should be considered in addition to the probation period (not including it). This independence period does not impact the default rate computation, not to bias PD estimates.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:28]
PARAGRAPH_95345: As the LGD estimates should be based on the institution's own experience, it is important that all relevant data be properly recorded and stored. The scope of data necessary for proper LGD estimation is very broad, and entails not only the date of default and all cash flows and events after default, but also all relevant information on the obligors and transactions that could be used as risk drivers in the model development. The reference data set (RDS) should include all information necessary for the model development as well as for calibration. For the purpose of LGD estimation, it should include complete information for all defaulted facilities observed during the historical observation period.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:28] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_95346: To ensure that the estimates are adequate for the existing portfolio, it is essential that the information about risk drivers be used consistently in the LGD estimation and in the application of LGD estimates. Hence, as the LGD estimates are applied to non-defaulted exposures, institutions should use the values of risk drivers from before the moment of default in the estimation of LGD.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:28]
PARAGRAPH_95347: One of the most important risk drivers in the LGD estimation is the existence of collaterals. The RDS should include all relevant information about the collaterals and the process of their realisation. In this context, it should be added that, as the observed and estimated recovery rates relate to the value of the collateral, the timing and type of valuation is a key aspect that may significantly influence the estimates. Although a more up-to-date valuation that was performed after default or in relation to default may be available, this information should not be used in the estimation of LGD

PARAGRAPH_95351: because this valuation is not comparable to the valuation of collateral for non-defaulted exposures. Valuations performed after default are often more conservative, so the use of such information could lead to overestimation of recovery rates.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29]
PARAGRAPH_95352: In some cases, the information necessary for the LGD estimation may be collected by institutions on a portfolio rather than on an individual basis. This may take place in particular in the case of indirect costs and sales of portfolios of credit obligations. The relevant information about costs and recoveries has to be adequately allocated to individual exposures whenever this is a necessary step for the purpose of LGD model development and, in any case, for the calculation of the long-run average in the calibration phase. In any case, the allocation methodology should not lead to a bias in the estimation of LGD. The simplest methodologies used for this purpose may be based on the exposure values. However, in some cases more sophisticated approaches may be necessary. In particular, in the case of the sale of credit obligations, the methodology for the allocation of recoveries should take into account possible significant heterogeneity of exposures subject to the sale, and the need to preserve their specificities as relevant drivers for the expected recoveries. In addition, in the case of the sale of secured credit obligations, institutions may allocate the value of recoveries (i.e. part of the sale price) to the existing collaterals. However, the need to use this additional allocation of recoveries to collaterals will depend on the regularity of occurrence of the sales of credit obligations as a recovery scenario, as well as on the estimation methodology chosen by the institution.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29]
PARAGRAPH_95354: It has been clarified that, for the purpose of LGD estimation, the recoveries realised with the use of collaterals have to be treated as such regardless of the form of the realisation of the collateral. This might include not only workout processes through court proceedings but also sale of the collateral by the obligor, normally with the consent of the institution, or the sale of the credit obligation where the collateral is reflected in the price. The list of possible ways of realising the collateral provided in the GL is non-exhaustive and includes only the most common forms. However, depending on the type of collateral and on the applicable legal framework, other eligible methods should also be recognised by institutions to identify cash flows stemming from realising the collaterals.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29]
PARAGRAPH_95355: Broader clarification has been provided for a specific case where the collateral is repossessed by the institution, in exchange for decreasing the credit obligation. It is proposed that this event should be treated as recovery, as from an economic perspective such an event is equivalent to receiving a cash payment and investing it in an asset. However, as the value of repossession does not always reflect accurately the market value of the asset, this uncertainty should be addressed by applying an appropriate haircut to the value of repossession. Although institutions may have different strategies with regard to the repossessed assets, and in particular in some cases they may decide to keep the asset on their balance sheet for speculative purposes, these different strategies should not influence the value of the recovery. Therefore, it has been specified that the haircut should be estimated on the assumption that the institution intends to sell the repossessed asset as soon as reasonably possible. Wherever sufficient past experience with regard to repossession of collaterals exists, the haircuts should be supported by historical observations and regularly back-tested. In the absence of

PARAGRAPH_95360: Furthermore, clarification has been provided with regard to the treatment of situations where institutions sell credit obligations, and these obligations may be secured by collaterals. As it is often not possible to allocate part of the price received for the credit obligation to the value of collateral in a reliable manner, it is possible under certain circumstances to exclude these observations from the sample used for the purpose of model development. However, such allocation is not necessary for the purpose of calculation of realised LGD. In any case, realised LGD has to be calculated for each defaulted observation, and all observations have to be taken into account in calculating long-run average LGD.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:30]
PARAGRAPH_95364: As part of these general principles, it has been specified which types of potential risk drivers should be taken into account by institutions. These include factors related to transactions and obligors but also to institutions themselves, in particular in terms of the organisation of recovery processes, as well as external factors such as legal frameworks, especially where models apply to exposures in various countries. It is important that institutions duly analyse potential risk drivers and choose those that meaningfully differentiate risk of transactions. In addition, the risk drivers should be analysed at an appropriate reference date that is representative of the realisations of the given risk driver within a year before default. This has the purpose of ensuring consistency between the estimation and the application of LGD, where the estimates will apply to non-defaulted exposures.

PARAGRAPH_95366: Based on Article 108(2) of the CRR, it has been clarified that, for the purpose of LGD estimation, institutions may take into account any type of collateral as long as the requirement of Article 181(1)(f) of the CRR is met. It has been further clarified in the RTS on IRB assessment methodology that, to meet this requirement, the institution's internal policies should be at least fully consistent with the requirements of Section 3 of Chapter 4, Part Three, Title II of the CRR with regard to legal certainty and regular valuation of collateral. It is also envisaged that, for the purpose of LGD estimation, institutions may use specific types of collaterals that are not explicitly described in the mentioned Chapter 4 of the CRR. In these cases, the policies and procedures relating to internal requirements for valuation and legal certainty should be appropriate to the type of collateral in question.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:31]
PARAGRAPH_95377: The concepts of economic loss and realised LGD are the basis for LGD estimation and any differences in the calculation may lead to significantly different and non-comparable LGD estimates. Therefore, it was considered essential to specify these concepts in detail, including the treatment of fees, interest and additional drawings after default, discounting rate, and costs. The specification was based on the definitions included in the CRR, but provides more detailed clarifications on the practical application of these definitions.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:31]
PARAGRAPH_95378: In particular, additional clarification is provided on the calculation of realised LGD for the observations that returned to non-defaulted status. It is considered that an assumption that these cases are always related to zero loss would not be prudent. Instead, institutions should calculate the loss realised on these exposures in the same manner as for all other defaulted observations, with the only difference being that an artificial cash flow is added to the calculation in the amount of the outstanding obligation at the moment of the return to non-defaulted status. Therefore, for the purpose of calculating the realised LGD, the exposure that returned to non-defaulted status would be treated in the same manner as if it was fully repaid at the date of the change of status.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:31]
PARAGRAPH_95379: The additional artificial cash flow should be discounted to the moment of default in the same manner as all other cash flows. This not only will ensure consistency with the fully repaid observations, but is also consistent with the concept of discounting factor, which reflects uncertainty around the cash flows on defaulted exposures that existed at the moment of default.

PARAGRAPH_95381: With regard to the treatment of fees, interest after default and additional drawdowns after default (referred to in the CRR as additional drawings), it was considered that, to reflect correctly the level of loss, these should also be included in the calculation up to the moment of default. Therefore, all fees and interest outstanding at the moment of default should be included in the amount of outstanding obligation at the moment of default. In this sense, the treatment of fees and interests should be

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:32] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_95386: Furthermore, in specifying the treatment of additional drawings after the moment of default, it was considered that the resulting measure of realised LGD should be consistent with the exposure value that will be used for the purpose of calculation of capital requirements. Hence, where additional drawings after default are included in the conversion factors, the outstanding amount in the denominator of the realised LGD should also include such drawings. However, in the case of retail exposures, where the conversion factors do not include any drawings after the moment of default, the denominator of the realised LGD should also reflect only the outstanding amount at the moment of default. As a result, lower exposure value (based on lower conversion factors) will be compensated for by higher LGD.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:32]
PARAGRAPH_95387: Similarly, in the case of additional fees or interests that are capitalised after the moment of default, as these are generally not included in the conversion factors they should not increase the amount outstanding at the moment of default. It is also considered that, as such fees and interests are not related to outgoing cash flow, they should not increase the economic loss in the numerator of the realised LGD. However, where these additional fees cover costs that were incurred by the institution, these should be included in the calculation of economic loss as costs. It is assumed that the unrealised gains from fees and interest should not be considered losses if they are not related to any expenses incurred by the institution. However, recoveries on those items are profits realised by the institution and hence can decrease the economic loss. Therefore, all recovery cash flows realised on a given exposure should be included in the calculation of realised LGDs.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:32] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_95388: To keep consistency between the LGD and exposure value, including conversion factors, different calculation of the denominator of the realised LGD is proposed, depending on whether or not additional drawings after default are included in the estimation of conversion factors or not. However, this optionality does not refer to the measure of economic loss, i.e. the numerator of the realised LGD, as this should be an objective value that adequately reflects the actual value of loss experienced by the institution. As additional drawings after default are related to an outflow of cash from an institution, they should always be included in the calculation of economic loss in the numerator of realised LGD.

PARAGRAPH_95389: Discounting rate

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:32]
PARAGRAPH_95390: The EBA has considered various possibilities with regard to the discounting rate, and analysed various practices in that regard. Approaches used by institutions include the use of discounting factors based on effective interest rates of the underlying loans, various add-ons in the range of 0 to 10% and even higher in some cases, and various underlying internal and external interest rate benchmarks. As significantly different approaches are currently used by institutions, the discounting factor was recognised as one of the main drivers of non-risk-based variability of the LGD estimates. The proposed solution of using interbank funding rates and a 5% add-on has the advantage of being simple and contributing to increased comparability of LGD estimates. It is considered appropriate that the discounting rate should not depend on the credit standing of the institution, so the discounting rate does not reflect funding costs but rather is focused on the uncertainty inherent in the recovery processes and the time value of money.

PARAGRAPH_95394: For exposures in currencies other than the euro, and for observations from before the adoption of euro, an equivalent interest rate should be used that is applicable for the currency of the exposure. This comparable rate should be sufficiently liquid to reflect the level of risk at the date of default in a correct manner.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:33]
PARAGRAPH_95395: The discounting rate specified in the GL is expected to reflect the average economic conditions that are adequate for the purpose of the long-run average LGD. It is not considered to be associated with downturn conditions. The downturn adjustment should be specified in accordance with the requirements of the RTS on the nature, severity and duration of economic downturn, which will be specified on the basis of Article 181(3)(a) of the CRR.

Furthermore, the EBA will also aim to publish a list of equivalent interbank rates for currencies other than euro, which should be used for the purpose of realised LGD calculation for exposures denominated in those currencies.

PARAGRAPH_95397: Direct and indirect costs

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:33]
PARAGRAPH_95398: With regard to costs to be included in the calculation of the economic loss the proposal follows the distinction between direct and indirect costs, depending on whether or not they are directly attributable to a given exposure. It has been specified that all direct costs should be considered material, whereas immaterial indirect costs may be excluded from the calculation.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:33]
PARAGRAPH_95399: To reflect the full level of loss, it is proposed that institutions should look into costs not only after the moment of default but also before that date. If the costs incurred by the institution due to diminished credit quality of the exposures but before recognition of default are not included in the exposure value at the moment of default, they should be taken into account in the calculation of economic loss. Otherwise these costs would not be accounted for in the estimation of risk parameters, and LGD would be underestimated.

These differing economic circumstances refer not only to the moment of default but also to the moment of realising recoveries from different sources. In this context, it was deemed inappropriate to allow elimination of any data that reflects an institution's internal experience, as this would lead to a loss of valuable information. Hence, it was specified that all available internal data should be taken into account in the long-run average LGD. This internal experience may additionally be supplemented by external data where necessary.

PARAGRAPH_95407: It has been clarified that the long-run average should be calculated as an arithmetic average of realised LGDs on all observations from the specified historical observation period, and that it should be weighted by the number of defaults. The only exemption from this rule under the CRR is specified in Article 181(2) of the CRR, according to which institutions may apply higher weights to more recent data in the case of retail exposures. However, the use of this exemption requires appropriate justification and evidence that it leads to better LGD estimates.

PARAGRAPH_95409: In accordance with Article 181(1)(a) of the CRR, all observed defaults have to be taken into account in the calculation of long-run average LGD; hence, incomplete recovery processes should also be included. These incomplete processes carry valuable information, in particular about the most recent observations, and cases that are particularly difficult and therefore require longer recovery processes. Exclusion of this information would not only lead to loss of relevant, up-to-date information, but could also lead to underestimation of LGD, and this was therefore considered inappropriate.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:34] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_95410: However, to obtain a realistic value of long-run average LGD, the incomplete recovery processes should be included with future recoveries that are expected to be realised. The value of future recoveries is not an objective, observed measure but has to be estimated based on the recoveries factually observed on those cases that are already closed. As a result, the 'long-run average LGD' will also be a measure that is not fully objective, as it contains components that are estimated.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:34] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_95411: To obtain a fully objective intermediate measure, it is proposed that institutions should also calculate the 'observed average LGD' taking into account realised LGDs only on those defaults that are related to closed recovery processes, including those that are treated as closed because they have reached a certain threshold in terms of the time in default, i.e. a maximum length of the recovery process during which additional recoveries can be reasonably expected. Although this objective measure will not include any elements of estimation, it has to be kept in mind that it may not accurately reflect the real experience, as the cure and high-recovery cases may be over-represented. More difficult cases usually stay longer in recovery processes, and therefore they are likely not to be included in the 'observed average LGD'.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:34]
PARAGRAPH_95412: Therefore, the 'observed average LGD' has to be adjusted to account for the most recent experience based on the incomplete recovery processes, to obtain an adequate long-run average LGD. For this purpose, institutions should estimate the most likely future recoveries on cases where the processes are not yet complete. As such estimates can be provided only where sufficient data exists to support them, it is proposed that institutions should estimate future recoveries only until a certain point in time, i.e. the maximum length of the recovery process during which a sufficient number of recoveries were actually observed in similar cases. The assumptions underlying the expected future costs and recoveries should be adequately justified and back-tested.

This floor should be applied at the level of individual observation, as it would not be appropriate to allow any netting effects in that regard between the observations included in the RDS, especially where these observations may have been observed in different periods of time.

PARAGRAPH_95419: While the flexibility is left for institutions to choose an appropriate estimation methodology, it is also necessary that, regardless of this choice, the estimates be calibrated to the long-run average LGD. The calibration may be performed either on a portfolio level or on a grade or pool level, depending on the chosen estimation methodology. In both cases, the calibration sample, i.e. the sample of exposures used to compare the average LGD estimates with the long-run average LGD, should be the same as the sample used to calculate the long-run average LGD. In accordance with Article 181(1)(b) of the CRR, these estimates reflecting the long-run average LGD should be used whenever they are more conservative than the estimates reflecting the downturn conditions.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:35]
PARAGRAPH_95423: The treatment of defaulted assets was identified as one of the major drivers of variability of the own funds requirements across institutions. Clarification has already been provided in the RTS on IRB assessment methodology, in particular in Article 54(2)(c), that direct estimation of LGD in-default should be consistent with the LGD for non-defaulted exposures, to avoid potential cliff effects. Following this approach, it has been further clarified in the GL that, for the purpose of estimating ELBE and LGD in-default, institutions should use the same estimation methods used for estimating LGD for non-defaulted exposures, as they are in fact part of the LGD model. Thus, Chapter 7 generally refers to the requirements on LGD estimation set out in Chapter 6, as well as general estimation requirements set out in Chapter 4, and the requirements on the application of risk parameters specified in Chapter 8. Chapter 7 provides guidance only on those specific aspects where different treatment for defaulted exposures in terms of loss rate estimation is justified.

Moreover, the ELBE is compared with credit risk adjustments for the purpose of calculating IRB shortfall / excess, where credit risk adjustments are again computed with respect to the current value of exposures. Thus, for the purpose of computing realised LGDs for defaulted exposures, institutions should use reference points in time that will be relevant for the current outstanding obligations of defaulted exposures.

PARAGRAPH_95429: The concept of current outstanding exposure is clearly defined in Article 166(1) of the CRR and should be used also for defaulted exposures in the application of the ELBE and LGD in-default. However, given data limitations, the continuous concept of current exposure amount may not be suitable for estimation purposes. The GL therefore suggest that institutions should set discrete relevant reference dates at which the realised LGDs should be computed. This way, it should be feasible to estimate the parameters for defaulted exposures that are appropriate for their current status. To ensure adequacy of the estimates, institutions should set the reference dates according to the recovery patterns observed on a specific type of exposures. Such reference dates may either be event based, e.g. linked with the realisation of collateral, or reflect certain time periods during which exposures have been in default.

PARAGRAPH_95430: For the purpose of application of the estimated LGD in-default and ELBE to a given defaulted exposure in the current portfolio, institutions should first evaluate which reference date is relevant for the exposure under consideration. In accordance with Article 158(5) of the CRR, the amount of expected loss to be assigned to the defaulted exposure under consideration should be calculated as the product of the ELBE relevant at the selected reference date, in percentage terms, and the current exposure value.

The scope of data necessary for proper ELBE and LGD in-default estimation includes not only those required for LGD for non-defaulted exposures, but also all relevant information obtained during the recovery process and, in particular, at each reference date used in the estimation. This implies that, for the purpose of the treatment of defaulted exposures, institutions should additionally store data including relevant risk drivers, which may become relevant after default, and outstanding exposure amounts and values of collaterals at each reference date.

Article 54(2) of RTS on IRB assessment methodology prescribes that the LGD in-default and ELBE estimation methods take into account the information on the time in default and recoveries realised so far. In this respect, the GL clarify that the information on recoveries realised so far and on time in default may be taken into account either directly, as risk drivers, or indirectly, in setting the reference dates for estimation purposes. Moreover, to ensure that the information after default is taken into account in a timely manner, it is clarified that the relevance of risk drivers should be re-evaluated for the relevant periods after default, until the date of termination of the recovery process. This implies, for example, that new risk drivers might become relevant after the date of default.

PARAGRAPH_95440: One major difference between the calculation of realised LGDs for the purpose of estimation of risk parameters for defaulted and non-defaulted exposures is that the former should be performed at each relevant reference date, rather than at the date of default, as described above. Other than this, to calculate realised LGDs for defaulted exposures institutions should follow the same requirements as those set out in Chapter 6. This implies that institutions should calculate for each defaulted exposure in the RDS the realised LGDs according to each reference date that is relevant for estimation purposes.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:37] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_95441: Another important aspect clarified in this section concerns the treatment of incomplete recovery processes for the purposes of calculation of long-run average LGD for defaulted exposures. The approach to the long-run average LGD is aligned with that prescribed in Section 6.4, with the exception that incomplete recovery processes should be used only for those reference dates for which observations of recoveries and costs are available at least until the next reference date. The rationale for this exception is to avoid a circular reference in the estimates and to ensure that each observation included in the calculation brings additional information. In fact, incomplete recovery processes on which ELBE and LGD in-default are estimated should not take part in the estimation itself and will be therefore excluded, if only those incomplete recovery processes for which later reference dates are relevant are taken into account.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:37]
PARAGRAPH_95442: The application of the same requirements for the treatment of incomplete recovery processes, as specified in Section 6.4, also means that no further recoveries should be estimated beyond the maximum length of the recovery processes specified for the specific type of exposures. However, relevant exposure-specific information may be taken into account in the process of application of the risk parameters, and may provide the basis for an override of the model output where justified.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:37]
PARAGRAPH_95443: Similarly in the case of partial write-offs performed on a defaulted exposure, while the estimation of the risk parameters should be based on a full outstanding credit obligation, the information on the partial write-off on a specific exposure may provide the basis for an override of the output of the model. Such an override would have the purpose of achieving consistency between the estimation and the application of the risk parameters, taking into account the fact that the risk weight and the expected loss amount will be calculated on the basis of the accounting value of the exposure, determined in accordance with Article 166 of the CRR.

Taking this into consideration, the GL clarify that the ELBE should not include any MoC, as this would not be in line with the best estimate concept. Adding conservativeness does not increase the accuracy of the estimates, but rather covers for the risk that the estimates might be too optimistic.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:40]
PARAGRAPH_95548: For the purposes of considering current economic circumstances, the GL clarify that institutions should take into account economic factors, including macroeconomic and credit factors, that are relevant for the type of exposures under consideration. In this context, institutions should obtain their ELBE estimates through an adjustment to the long-run average LGD for defaulted exposures, where necessary, consistently with the estimation of LGD in-default, such that a meaningful application of the risk weight formula is ensured. The difference between LGD in-default and ELBE determines the level of unexpected loss, which is used for computing the risk weight. Therefore, the GL aim to ensure consistency of the estimation approaches used for the two risk parameters.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:40]
PARAGRAPH_95549: To avoid excessive use of adjustments and hence increased subjectivity of resulting estimates, it is specified in the GL that the adjustment should be applied only where necessary. The adjustment may be necessary where the observed sensitivity of realised LGDs to economic conditions is not reflected in the ELBE estimates, either through direct use of macroeconomic factors in the model or through risk drivers which are sensitive to economic conditions. In all other cases, it is considered that the ELBE estimates based on the long-run average LGD for defaulted exposures sufficiently reflect current economic conditions, and that no further adjustments to address this issue should be made. Where the adjustment is applied, it should be adequately documented, including its rationale and calculation.

PARAGRAPH_95550: Relation of ELBE to specific credit risk adjustments

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:40] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_95551: The calculation of the IRB excess/shortfall in accordance with Article 159 of the CRR is based on a comparison between expected losses and credit risk adjustments. In this context, using accounting provisions as ELBE estimates is a frequent practice observed within European institutions. However, this approach is considered inappropriate, as it does not ensure compliance with the CRR requirements. To ensure consistency between the ELBE and LGD in-default estimates, the GL restrict the use of provisions as ELBE to two specific circumstances. The first refers to those cases where a model used to determine accounting provisions respects all the requirements for own LGD estimates set out in the CRR and in these GL, or where the provisions can be adjusted to meet those requirements, in particular those related to the concept of economic loss. The second possibility refers to those cases where provisions are individually assessed, so there is no model behind them. In these circumstances, the information of the individual assessment could be used as a potential reason for an override of the ELBE model outcomes where institutions are able to prove that this improves the accuracy of the estimation for a given exposure. For this purpose, individually assessed provisions should be adjusted to be consistent with the requirements on economic loss set in these GL.

PARAGRAPH_95553: According to Article 54(1) of the RTS on IRB assessment methodology, institutions may estimate LGD in-default either directly or as a sum of ELBE and an add-on that captures the unexpected loss that might occur during the recovery period. Irrespective of the approach, it is expected that the method for the estimation of LGD for exposures in default should consider a possible adverse change in economic conditions during the expected length of the recovery process, in accordance with Article

PARAGRAPH_95557: 54(2)(a) of the RTS on IRB assessment methodology. It is clarified in the GL that, to reflect the adverse change in economic conditions, institutions should reflect in their LGD in-default estimates at least downturn conditions. This is in line with Article 181(1)(b) of the CRR, as LGD in-default is in fact part of an LGD model. However, estimates of LGD in-default reflecting downturn conditions do not preclude the inclusion of additional sources of uncertainty that are not related to economic conditions during the recovery process. For the purpose of considering additional unexpected losses mentioned in Article 181(1)(h) of the CRR, institutions may therefore need to increase the LGD in- default over the downturn level. Finally, like the LGD for non-defaulted exposures, the LGD in-default should also include adequate MoC. In this context, irrespective of which of the approaches is used for LGD in-default estimation, institutions should always be able to document:

These weaknesses may include, in particular, missing or outdated information necessary for the rating assignment in accordance with the model (for example missing update of the financial statement of the obligor), missing rating or update of the rating of the obligor. Institutions should be able to detect and monitor these situations to make sure that the risk is reflected correctly, including additional conservatism where necessary.

PARAGRAPH_95584: The proposed rules for the use of human judgement in the application of risk parameters are based on Article 172(3) of the CRR, which allows the overriding of both inputs to and outputs from the process of assignment of obligors or exposures to grades or pools. The requirements for overrides apply equally to PD and LGD models, including ELBE and LGD in-default. In any case, where institutions want to apply the overrides, this should be based on an appropriate internal framework to make sure that the weaknesses of the assignment are identified consistently, that the overrides are applied within certain limits and that they are appropriately justified, approved and monitored. As a large number of overrides may indicate certain weaknesses of the model, institutions should analyse these situations carefully, taking into account the reasons for overrides. Where necessary, such analysis should result in the improvement of the model, for instance by including additional risk drivers, increasing granularity of categorisation or changing the weights of risk drivers, or in the improvement of data collection or data quality management processes.

PARAGRAPH_95586: The concept of use test was introduced in the IRB Approach to ensure high quality of risk parameters, under the assumption that institutions would not use the estimates of risk parameters for internal risk management if they did not believe that these estimates appropriately reflect the actual level of risk. However, for the purpose of own funds requirements it is important not only to accurately assess the obligors and exposures, and to rank them according to the level of risk, but also to ensure certain level of conservatism. These additional prudential requirements may lead to the parameters less accurately reflecting the actual level of risk under certain economic circumstances. It is therefore specified in the GL that, for internal purposes, institutions may decide, where this is justified, to use the estimates of the risk parameters without MoC, without regulatory floors or, in the case of LGD, without downturn adjustment.

PARAGRAPH_95590: Furthermore, where this is justified for a specific area of use, it may be necessary to use a different calibration method for internal purposes. This different method may in particular involve specifying a different calibration target (for instance, the use of lifetime horizon instead of a one-year time horizon on PD estimates, where this is required by the applicable accounting standards), or may aim to have the parameters more accurately reflect the current economic circumstances. The calibration method may also include additional risk drivers applied at the stage of calibration. In any case, however, the rank ordering of obligors or exposures should remain the same as used for the purpose of own funds requirements, apart from possibly different grouping of exposures into grades. The change in rank ordering would mean that not only different estimates but also different internal ratings are used internally, so the use test requirement would not be met.

PARAGRAPH_95591: The requirements for use test specified in these GL should be read together with the RTS on IRB assessment methodology, which in Articles 18 to 21 specify obligatory and optional areas of use test. While the GL provide an exhaustive list of possible deviations from the parameters used for own funds requirements calculation, the use of parameters in both obligatory and optional areas of use test does not preclude taking into account the information from other sources as well. The combination of the information on internal ratings or risk parameters and any other relevant information should lead to an appropriate management decision in accordance with the institution's policy.

PARAGRAPH_95592: Calculation of IRB shortfall or excess

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:43] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_95593: Apart from the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts the risk parameters are also used for regulatory purposes in the calculation of the expected loss and so-called IRB shortfall or IRB excess, which is then used to correct the value of own funds used in the calculation of capital adequacy ratios. Article 159 of the CRR requires institutions to calculate the difference between, on one hand, credit risk adjustments, additional value adjustments, and, on the other hand, own funds reductions and expected loss amounts. The GL refer to IRB excess where this calculation results in a positive amount, i.e. where provisions are in excess of expected loss, and to IRB shortfall where it results in a negative amount, i.e. there is a shortfall of provisions given the expected loss. It has been clarified in Article 73(h) of the RTS on assessment methodology that this difference should be calculated at an aggregate level separately for the portfolio of defaulted exposures and the portfolio of exposures that are not in default. This separation is necessary to ensure that the IRB excess resulting from the calculation performed for the defaulted portfolio is not used to offset IRB shortfall resulting from the calculation performed for the portfolio of exposures that are not in default, as prescribed in Article 159 of the CRR. However, the IRB excess from the overall non-defaulted portfolio may be used to cover any IRB shortfall from the overall defaulted portfolio. It is furthermore clarified that, if the calculation required by Article 159 of the CRR results in an IRB excess for both the defaulted and the non-defaulted portfolio, the limit for adding the overall IRB excess to Tier 2 capital set out in Article 62(d) of the CRR, i.e. up to 0.06% of risk-weighted exposure amounts, should be applied to the sum of the two IRB excesses.

These ITS also clarify that write-offs can be caused both by reductions of the carrying amount of financial assets recognised directly in profit or loss, and by reductions in the amounts of the allowance accounts for credit losses taken against the carrying amount of financial assets. Such partial write-offs do not constitute impairment, irrespective of the method (specific loan loss provision or direct reduction of the carrying amount) chosen to book impairment in the financial statements of the asset, because any amounts written-off following a derecognition will not affect the carrying amount of the financial asset (unlike a reversal of impairment losses). For that reason, a partial write-off would not be included in the calculation of general and specific credit risk adjustments.

PARAGRAPH_95600: This chapter provides additional guidance for institutions with regard to their policies on the maintenance of the models, including regular review of estimates. To ensure that the deterioration of the model performance is detected and addressed in a timely manner, the GL clarify what institutions should consider in their internal frameworks for annual reviews, as required by Article 179(1)(c) of the CRR, and what should be the minimum scope of analysis that institutions conduct during this annual review. The review of estimates is required when new information comes to light, and at least on an annual basis. Moreover, institutions are asked to define a cycle for a fundamental review of models depending on the materiality of the models considered. In accordance with the GL, the scope of annual review includes the analysis of representativeness, the performance of the model, its stability over time and its predictive power. Full reviews including model design may be performed on a less frequent basis.

PARAGRAPH_95601: While the annual reviews referred to in Article 179(1)(c) of the CRR may be performed either by the model development function, which is part of the credit risk control unit or units (CRCU) or by the validation function, the required scope and frequency of validation is not within the scope of these GL. The role of independent validation has been further clarified in the RTS on IRB assessment methodology, in particular in Article 10 of these RTS, which specifies criteria for the independence of the validation function from model development, and in Article 11, which clarifies the minimum frequency and scope of validation. Therefore the requirements included in the GL are focused on the reviews of estimates in accordance with Article 179(1)(c) of the CRR.

In this sense, both the annual reviews and full reviews of estimates can be seen as part of the ongoing reviews by the CRCU as specified in Article 190(2)(h) of the CRR, even if partly or fully performed by the validation function, as long as the CRCU is provided with the results of validation.

PARAGRAPH_95692: 12. A rating system in the sense of point (1) of Article 142(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 should cover all those exposures where the obligors or facilities show common drivers of risk and credit-worthiness and fundamentally comparable availability of credit-related information. The PD and LGD model within a rating system may comprise various calibration segments. Where all obligors or exposures within the range of application of the PD or LGD model are jointly calibrated the whole scope of application of the model is considered one calibration segment.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:52]
PARAGRAPH_95693: 13. Exposures covered by the same rating system should be treated similarly by the institution in terms of risk management, decision making and credit approval process and should be assigned to a common obligor rating scale for the purposes of Article 170(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and a common facility rating scale for the purposes of Article 170(1)(e) of that Regulation.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:52]
PARAGRAPH_95694: 14. For the purpose of quantification of various risk parameters within a rating system, institutions should apply the same definition of default for the same historical observations used in different models. Institutions should also apply the same treatment of multiple defaults of the same obligor or exposure across internal, external and pooled data sources.

Institutions should analyse the representativeness of data in the case of statistical models and other mechanical methods used to assign exposures to grades or pools, as well as in the case of statistical default prediction models generating default probability estimates for individual obligors or facilities. Institutions should select an appropriate dataset for the purpose of model development to ensure that the performance of the model on the application portfolio, in particular its discriminatory power, is not significantly hindered by insufficient representativeness of data.

PARAGRAPH_95716: 22. For the purpose of paragraph 21(a) institutions should analyse the segmentation of exposures and consider whether there were any changes to the scope of application of the considered model over the period covered by the data used in developing the model for assigning obligors or exposures to grades or pools. Where such changes were observed institutions should analyse the risk drivers relevant for the change of the scope of application of the model by comparing their distribution in the RDS before and after the change as well as with the distribution of those risk drivers in the application portfolio. For this purpose institutions should apply statistical methodologies such as cluster analysis or similar techniques to demonstrate representativeness. In the case of pooled models the analysis should be performed with regard to the part of the scope of the model that is used by an institution.

PARAGRAPH_95722: 24. For the purpose of paragraph 21(c) institutions should analyse the distribution and range of values of key risk characteristics of the data used in developing the model for risk differentiation in comparison with the application portfolio. With regard to LGD models, institutions should perform such analysis separately for non-defaulted and defaulted exposures.

Institutions should analyse the representativeness of the data in terms of the structure of the portfolio by relevant risk characteristics based on statistical tests specified in their policies to ensure that the range of values observed on these risk characteristics in the application portfolio is adequately reflected in the development sample. Where the application of statistical tests is not possible, institutions should carry out at least a qualitative analysis on the basis of the descriptive statistics of the structure of the portfolio, taking into account the possible seasoning effects referred to in Article 180(2)(f) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.

For the purpose of paragraph 21(d) institutions should analyse whether, over the relevant historical observation period, there were significant changes in their lending standards or recovery policies or in the relevant legal environment, including changes in insolvency law, legal foreclosure procedures and any legal regulations related to realisation of collaterals, which may influence the level of risk or the distribution or ranges of the risk characteristics in the portfolio covered by the considered model. Where institutions observe such changes they should compare the data included in the RDS before and after the change of the policy. Institutions should ensure comparability of the current underwriting or recovery standards with those applied to the observations included in the RDS and used for model development.

PARAGRAPH_95729: 27. Within the PD model the representativeness of data used in developing the model for risk differentiation does not require that the proportion of defaulted and non-defaulted exposures in this dataset be equal to the proportion of defaulted and non-defaulted exposures in the institution's application portfolio. However, institutions should have a sufficient number of defaulted and non-defaulted observations in the development dataset and they should document the difference.

PARAGRAPH_95853: 59. Institutions should ensure that the decrease of reliability of information over time, for instance of information on obligor characteristics obtained at the time of the loan origination, is appropriately reflected in the PD estimation. Institutions should also ensure that the model estimates the proper level of risk with respect to all relevant, currently available and most up- to-date information and that an adequate MoC is applied where a higher degree of uncertainty exists due to the lack of up-to-date information. In particular the model or the assignment process should provide for an adequate and conservative adjustment in both of the following situations:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:63]
PARAGRAPH_95854: (a) in accordance with Article 24(1)(g) of the RTS on IRB assessment methodology, in case of financial statements older than 24 months where information stemming from these financial statements is a relevant risk driver;

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:63]
PARAGRAPH_95859: 62. Institutions should have clear policies specifying the conditions under which the rating of a third party who has a contractual or organisational relation with an obligor of the institution may be taken into account in the assessment of risk of the considered obligor. Such policies should take into account the following possible manners in which the rating of such a third party may be taken into account in the assessment of risk of the considered obligor:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_95863: (a) the rating of such third party being transferred to a relevant obligor ('rating transfer'), where there is no difference in risk between the obligor and the related party because of the existence of an appropriate guarantee and the rating of a third party is assigned internally in accordance with the rating system for which the institution has received permission in accordance with Article 143(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_95864: (b) the rating of a such third party being taken into account as an indication for an override of the assignment of the relevant obligor to a grade or pool;

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_95866: 63. In order for an internal or external ratings of a third party to be incorporated into a PD model, institutions should ensure all of the following:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_95867: (a) that the rating of a third party fulfils all the requirements for relevant risk drivers set out in section 5.2.2;

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_95868: (b) that other relevant obligor and transaction risk characteristics are properly reflected in the model in accordance with Articles 170(1)(a) and 170(3)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, and that no material biases are introduced by a high weighting of the internal or external rating information;

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_95869: (c) that there is no double counting of effects of any relations to third parties.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_95870: 64. A rating transfer should not change the assignment of exposures to exposure classes, rating systems or models, but should only affect the assignment to grades or pools. Rating transfers should be set up in such a way that any changes to a rating of a third party which is material information on the obligor or exposure with regard to Article 173(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 is reflected in all influenced ratings in a timely manner.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_95871: 65. The material contractual support granted by an obligor to a third party should be seen as diminishing the free financial strength of the supporting obligor, including the strength to repay all obligations to the institution in full. This should be reflected in the rating of the supporting obligor.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_95873: 66. Institutions should choose an appropriate philosophy underlying the assignment of obligors or exposures to grades or pools ('rating philosophy') taking into account all of the following principles:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_95874: (a) Institutions should assess whether the method used to quantify the risk parameter is adequate for the rating philosophy and understand the characteristics and dynamics of the assignment of obligors or exposures to grades or pools ('rating assignment') and of the risk parameter estimates that result from the method used.

PARAGRAPH_95878: (b) Institutions should assess the adequacy of the resulting characteristics and dynamics of the rating assignment and risk parameter estimates that result from the method used, with regard to their various uses and should understand their impact on the dynamics and volatility of own funds requirements.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:65]
PARAGRAPH_95879: (c) The rating philosophy should also be taken into account for back testing purposes. Philosophies sensitive to economic conditions tend to estimate PDs that are better predictors of each year's default rates. On the other hand, philosophies less sensitive to economic conditions tend to estimate PDs that are closer to the average PD across the various states of the economy, but that differ from observed default rates in years where the state of the economy is above or below its average. Deviations between observed default rates and the long-run average default rate of the relevant grade will hence be more likely in rating systems less sensitive to economic conditions. In contrast, migrations among grades will be more likely in rating systems which are more sensitive to economic conditions. These patterns should be taken into account when assessing the results of back-testing and, where relevant, benchmarking analysis.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:65]
PARAGRAPH_95880: 67. Institutions should apply the chosen rating philosophy consistently over time. Institutions should analyse the appropriateness of the philosophy underlying the assignment of obligors or exposures to grades or pools ('rating philosophy'), taking into account all of the following:

PARAGRAPH_95884: 68. Where institutions use different rating systems characterised by different rating philosophies, they should use the information on the rating assignments or risk parameters estimates with caution, especially when making use of rating information or default experience obtained from external rating agencies. Where institutions use different rating systems with different characteristics, such as different philosophies or different levels of objectivity, accuracy, stability, or conservatism, they should ensure that the rating systems have an appropriate level of consistency and that any differences between them are well understood. Such understanding should at least enable the institution to define an appropriate way to combine or aggregate the information produced by the various rating systems when this is necessary according to the institution's policies. Institutions should have full understanding of the assumptions and potential inaccuracies arising from such a combination or aggregation.

PARAGRAPH_95893: 70. For the purpose of calculating the one-year default rate defined in point (78) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should ensure the completeness of the quantitative and qualitative data and other information in relation to the denominator and numerator as outlined in paragraphs 73 and 74 and used for the calculation of the observed average default rate. In particular, institutions should ensure that at least the following data for the relevant observation period referred to in paragraphs 82 to 83 is properly stored and available:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:67]
PARAGRAPH_95908: 73. For the purpose of calculating the one-year default rate referred to in point (78) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should ensure both of the following:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:67]
PARAGRAPH_95909: (a) that the denominator consists of the number of non-defaulted obligors with any credit obligation observed at the beginning of the one-year observation period; in this context a credit obligation refers to both of the following:

PARAGRAPH_95911: (ii) any off-balance sheet items, including guarantees issued by the institution as a guarantor.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:67]
PARAGRAPH_95912: (b) that the numerator includes all those obligors considered in the denominator that had at least one default event during the one-year observation period.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:67] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_95913: 74. When assigning the obligors or exposures to grades or pools for the purpose of the one-year default rate calculation, institutions should take overrides into account, but they should not reflect in this assignment any substitution effects due to credit risk mitigation, nor any ex post conservative adjustments introduced in accordance with section 8.1. Where the one-year default rate is calculated by rating grade or pool, the denominator should refer to all obligors assigned to a rating grade or pool at the beginning of the observation period. Where the one- year default rate is calculated at the portfolio level, the denominator should refer to all obligors assigned to the relevant calibration segment at the beginning of the observation period.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:67]
PARAGRAPH_95914: 75. Institutions should calculate the one-year default rate also for the subset of obligors with any credit obligation that did not have a rating at the start of the relevant observation period, but which were within the range of application of the model under consideration ('missing ratings'), even if these obligors were assigned to a rating grade or pool in a conservative manner for the purpose of calculation of own funds requirements. Obligors whose ratings are based on missing or partly missing information or where the rating is outdated but still deemed valid by the institution should not be considered as missing ratings.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:67]
PARAGRAPH_95915: 76. For the purposes of paragraphs 73 to 75 an obligor has to be included in the denominator and, where relevant, numerator, also in the case of a migration to a different rating grade, pool or rating model, rating system or approach to calculation of capital requirements within the observation period or where the corresponding credit obligations were sold, written off,

PARAGRAPH_95923: 79. The observed average of one-year default rates ('observed average default rate') should be calculated for each rating grade or pool and additionally for the type of exposures covered by the relevant PD model as well as for any relevant calibration segment.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:68]
PARAGRAPH_95924: 80. Institutions should choose an appropriate approach between an approach based on overlapping and an approach based on non-overlapping one-year time windows, to calculate the observed average default rate based on a documented analysis. This analysis should include at least the following:

PARAGRAPH_95929: 81. For the purposes of paragraphs 79 and 80 institutions should calculate the observed average default rates as the arithmetic average of all one year default rates calculated in accordance with paragraphs 73 to 76. In the case of PD models for retail exposure class institutions may calculate the observed average default rate as a weighted average of one-year default rates where an institution does not give equal importance to historic data because more recent data is a better predictor of losses in accordance with Article 180(2)(e) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.

PARAGRAPH_95936: 83. For the purpose of assessing the representativeness of the historical observation period referred to in paragraph 82 for the likely range of variability of one-year-default rates, institutions should assess whether the historical observation period contains a representative mix of good and bad years, and they should take into account all of the following:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:69]
PARAGRAPH_95937: (a) the variability of all observed one-year-default rates;

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:69]

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:69]
PARAGRAPH_95941: 85. Where the historical observation period referred to in paragraph 82 is not representative of the likely range of variability of default rates as referred to in Article 49(4) of the RTS on IRB assessment methodology, institutions should apply the following:

PARAGRAPH_95957: 88. Institutions should store and describe in the documentation of the PD model the calibration sample associated with each calibration segment. In order to ensure compliance with Article 180(1)(a) or 180(2)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should find an appropriate balance between the comparability of the calibration sample with the application portfolio in terms of obligor and transaction characteristics and its representativeness of the likely range of variability of default rates as referred to in section 5.3.4.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:70]
PARAGRAPH_95958: 89. Institutions should conduct the calibration after taking into account any overrides applied in the assignment of obligors to grades or pools, and before the application of MoC or floors to PD estimates as referred to in Articles 160(1) and 163(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Where a ranking method or overrides policy has changed over time, institutions should analyse the effects of these changes on the frequency and scope of overrides and take them into account appropriately.

PARAGRAPH_95980: 95. Where institutions derive PD estimates from the estimates of losses and LGDs in accordance with Articles 161(2) and 180(2)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 they should use a RDS that includes realised losses on all defaults identified during the historical observation period specified in accordance with section 6.3.2.1 and relevant drivers of loss.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:72]
PARAGRAPH_95981: 96. In order to use direct PD estimates for the calculation of own funds requirements in accordance with Article 169(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should demonstrate that the theoretical assumptions of the probability model underlying the estimation methodology are met to a sufficient extent in practice and that the long-run average default rate is retained. In particular, all data and representativeness requirements should be met, including those in Article 174(c) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, and the definition of default should be applied in accordance with Article 178 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Under no circumstances should the use of continuous PDs or any smoothening of default rates be adopted in order to overcome the lack of data, low discriminatory capacity or any other deficiencies in the rating assignment or PD estimation process, or to reduce the own funds requirements.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:72]
PARAGRAPH_95982: 97. Institutions may split exposures covered by the same PD model into as many different calibration segments as needed where one or more subsets of these exposures carry a significantly different level of risk. For this purpose institutions should use relevant segmentation drivers and they should justify and document the use and scope of the calibration segments.

PARAGRAPH_95983: 98. Where scoring methods are used, institutions should ensure that:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:72] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_95984: (a) where there is a change in the scoring method used, the institutions consider whether it is necessary to recalculate scores of obligors or exposures based on the original dataset instead of using scores that were calculated based on previous versions of the scoring method, and, where such recalculation is not possible, that institutions assess potential effects and take those effects into account via an appropriate increase of the MoC to their PD estimates;

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:72]
PARAGRAPH_95985: (b) where Article 180(1)(g) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 applies, the PD estimates which were derived as a simple average of individual PD estimates are adequate for relevant grades, by applying calibration tests to these estimates at a grade level, on the basis of one-year default rates representative of the likely range of variability of default rates.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:73]
PARAGRAPH_95993: 100. Institutions that have obtained permission to use own estimates of LGD in accordance with Article 143(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 should assign an LGD estimate to each non-defaulted exposure and an estimate of LGD in-default and ELBE to each defaulted exposure within the range of application of the rating system subject to such permission in accordance with Articles 172 and 173 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Institutions should estimate LGDs for all facility grades of the distinct facility rating scale or for all pools that are incorporated in the rating system. For the purpose of LGD estimation institutions should treat each defaulted facility as a distinct default observation, unless more than one independent defaults were recognised on a single facility which do not meet the conditions of paragraph 101.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:73]
PARAGRAPH_95994: 101. For the purpose of LGD estimation, with regard to defaults recognised on a single facility, where the time between the moment of the return of the exposure to non-defaulted status and the subsequent classification as default is shorter than nine months, institutions should treat such exposure as having been constantly defaulted from the first moment when the default occurred. Institutions may specify a period longer than nine months for the purpose of considering two subsequent defaults as a single default in the LGD estimation, if this is adequate to the specific type of exposures and reflects the economic meaning of the default experience.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:73]
PARAGRAPH_95995: 102. Institutions should estimate their own LGDs based on their own loss and recovery experience, as it is reflected in historical data on defaulted exposures. Institutions may supplement their own historical data on defaulted exposures with external data. In particular, institutions should not derive their LGD estimates only from the market prices of financial instruments, including, but not limited to, marketable loans, bonds or credit default instruments, but they may use this information to supplement their own historical data.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:74]
PARAGRAPH_96003: 105. Institutions should be able to demonstrate that the methods that they choose for the purpose of LGD estimation are appropriate to their activities and the type of exposures to which the estimates apply and they should be able to justify the theoretical assumptions underlying those methods. The methods used in the LGD estimation should in particular be consistent with the collection and recovery policies adopted by the institution and should take into account possible recovery scenarios as well as potential differences in the legal environment in relevant jurisdictions.

PARAGRAPH_96052: 116. For the purpose of point (b) of paragraph 115 institutions should determine the value of repossession as the value by which the credit obligation of the obligor has been diminished as a result of the repossession of the collateral, and with which the repossessed collateral was recorded as an asset on the balance sheet of the institution. Where these values are different institutions should consider the lower of the two the value of repossession. The value of repossession should be considered a value of recovery at the date of repossession and should be included in the calculation of the economic loss and realised LGD in accordance with section 6.3.1.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:77]
PARAGRAPH_96053: 17. Institutions should consider whether the value of repossession adequately reflects the value of the repossessed collateral, consistently with any established internal requirements for collateral management, legal certainty and risk management. Where the collateral repossessed meets the criteria for high quality liquid assets at Level 1, as defined in Article 10 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61, institutions may take into account directly as a realised recovery the market value of the collateral at the time of the repossession. In all other cases institutions should apply an appropriate haircut to the value of repossession and include in the calculation of economic loss a recovery in the amount of the value of repossession after applying the appropriate haircut. Institutions should estimate this haircut taking into account all of the following conditions:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:77]
PARAGRAPH_96054: (a) the haircut should reflect possible errors in the valuation of the collateral at the moment of repossession taking into account the type of the valuation available at the moment of repossession, the date it was performed and the liquidity of the market for this type of asset;

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:77]
PARAGRAPH_96055: (b) the haircut should be estimated with the assumption that the institution intends to sell the repossessed collateral to an independent third party and should reflect the potential price that could be achieved from such sale, the costs of the sale and the discounting effect for the period from the sale to the moment of repossession taking into account the liquidity of the market for this type of assets;

PARAGRAPH_96075: 120. In accordance with point (f) of paragraph 115 institutions may specify and recognise any other forms of realising collaterals adequate to the types of collaterals used by the institution that are eligible under the applicable legal framework. When recognising such other forms of realising collateral, institutions should take into account the fact that the collateral may take various forms and that various forms of collaterals may be related to the same asset. Where different forms of collateral refer to the same asset but the realisation of one of the collaterals does not decrease the value of the other, institutions should consider them separate collaterals in the process of LGD estimation. In particular, institutions should recognise separately the form of collateral which gives a right to repossess or sell the asset (such as a mortgage) and the form of collateral which gives a right to collect cash flows generated by the asset (such as a cession of rent or fees).

PARAGRAPH_96078: 121. Institutions should identify and analyse potential risk drivers that are relevant to their specific circumstances and to the specific characteristics of the type of exposures covered by the rating system. Potential risk drivers analysed by institutions should include in particular the following:

PARAGRAPH_96083: 122. Institutions should analyse the risk drivers not only at the moment of default but also at least within a year before default. Institutions should use a reference date for a risk driver that is representative of the realisations of the risk driver within a year before default. When choosing the appropriate reference date for a risk driver institutions should take into account its volatility over time. Institutions should apply these practices also with regard to the reference date of the valuation of collateral; the value of the collateral at the reference date should not reflect the impact of the decrease in credit quality of the exposure shortly before default.

In accordance with Articles 170 and 181(1)(f) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 institutions may take into account in their LGD estimations the existence of any types of collaterals for which they have established internal requirements in terms of collateral management, legal certainty and risk management that are generally consistent with those set out in Section 3 of Chapter 4 of Title II in Part Three of that Regulation. In the case of the types of collateral that are not specified in Chapter 4 of Title II in Part Three of that Regulation institutions may use those types of collaterals in their LGD estimations where their policies and procedures relating to internal requirements for valuation and legal certainty of these collaterals are appropriate to the respective type of collateral.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:80]
PARAGRAPH_96090: 25. To the extent that LGD estimates take into account the existence of unfunded credit protection institutions should specify the criteria and methodology for recognising and including in their LGD estimates the protection in the form of guarantees and credit derivatives that meet the criteria specified in Article 60 of the RTS on IRB assessment methodology.

PARAGRAPH_96091: 126. Institutions should take into account as a risk driver or segmentation criterion information on all main types of collaterals that are used within the scope of application of the LGD model. Institutions should clearly define in their internal policies the main and other types of collaterals used for the type of exposures covered by the rating system and should ensure that, to the extent that LGD estimates take into account the existence of collateral, the policies regarding the management of these types of collateral comply with the requirement of Article 181(1)(f) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Institutions should specify the main types of collaterals in such a way that the cash flows from the remaining types of collaterals will not significantly bias the estimation of recoveries that are realised without the use of collaterals.

Collaterals which do not meet the requirement of Article 181(1)(f) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 cannot be included as a risk driver in the LGD estimation and the cash flows received from those collaterals should be treated as if they had been received without the use of collaterals. Regardless of this treatment in the LGD estimation, institutions should collect the information about the source of the cash flows related to those collaterals and allocate them as related to those collaterals. Institutions should regularly monitor the levels of such cash flows as well as the extent to which the relevant types of collaterals are used. Where necessary, institutions should perform appropriate adjustments in order to avoid any bias in the LGD estimates.

PARAGRAPH_96100: (b) where institutions estimate separate recovery rates for specific types of collaterals, they should avoid a bias that may stem from including in the estimation sample the observations where the exposure was secured by only a part of the value of the collateral. For this purpose institutions should take reasonable steps to obtain the data on the total value of the collateral and total sale price of the collateral and include this information in the estimation where it is available;

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:81]
PARAGRAPH_96101: (c) where institutions estimate separate recovery rates for specific types of collaterals they should recognise and include in this estimation direct costs related to the collection on each of these specific types of collaterals separately as well;

PARAGRAPH_96102: (d) where institutions estimate separate recovery rates for specific types of collaterals they should include in this estimation all recoveries realised from a specific type of collateral including those realised on exposures where the realisation of the collateral has been completed but the overall recovery process has not yet been closed;

PARAGRAPH_96103: (e) where the same collateral covers several exposures, institutions should specify an adequate allocation methodology in order to avoid double counting of collaterals; the allocation methodology should be consistent between the LGD estimation and the application of LGD estimates and with the methodology used for accounting purposes;

PARAGRAPH_96104: (f) the estimates should not be based solely on the estimated market value of the collateral but they should also take into account the realised recoveries from past liquidations and the potential inability of an institution to gain control and liquidate the collateral. For this purpose, institutions should take into account in the estimation those historical observations where the collateral could not be realised or where the recovery process was longer than expected, due to inability or difficulty to gain control or liquidate the collateral. Where institutions estimate the recovery rates related to specific types of collaterals, they should take into account the time between the moment of default and the time when the cash flows related to the collection on these types of collaterals have been received and should include in the estimation those observations where the collateral has not been realised as a result of inability to gain control;

PARAGRAPH_96108: (g) the estimates should take into account the potential decreases in collateral value from the point of LGD estimation to the eventual recovery, in particular those resulting from changes in the market conditions, the state and age of the collateral and, where relevant, currency fluctuations. Where institutions have experienced decreases in values of collaterals and these are already reflected in observed recoveries, no further adjustments to the LGD estimates based on these observations should be made. Where potential decreases in values of collaterals are not reflected in historical observations or where institutions predict further, potentially more severe decreases in the future, they should be included in the quantification of LGD estimates by means of an appropriate adjustment based on forward-looking expectations. However, the LGD estimates should not be adjusted to take into account any potential increases in collateral value;

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:83]

Where, relating to a default event, any part of exposure has been forgiven or written off before or at the date of default and the amount forgiven or written off is not included in the outstanding amount of the credit obligation at the moment of default the amount of the exposure that was forgiven or written off should be added to the outstanding amount of the credit obligation at the moment of default for both the calculation of economic loss as specified in paragraph 132 in the numerator, and the calculation of the outstanding amount of credit obligation in the denominator of the realised LGD.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:83]
PARAGRAPH_96124: 135. In the case of exposures that return to non-defaulted status, institutions should calculate economic loss as for all other defaulted exposures with the only difference that an additional recovery cash flow should be added to the calculation as if a payment had been made by the obligor in the amount that was outstanding at the date of the return to non-defaulted status, including any principal, interests and fees ('artificial cash flow'). This artificial cash flow should be discounted to the moment of default in the same manner as all observed cash flows. Where the exposures meet the criteria of paragraph 101, the realised LGD should be calculated with the reference to the date of the first default event taking into account all cash flows observed from the date of the first default event, including those observed during the period between the first and the second defaulted status, without adding any artificial cash flows.

PARAGRAPH_96125: 136. Where institutions open new facilities to replace previously defaulted facilities as part of restructuring or for technical reasons, they should calculate the realised LGDs based on the originally defaulted facilities.

For the purpose of Article 181(1)(i) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should take into account in the calculation of realised LGD any fees for delays in payments that have been capitalised in the institution's income statement before the moment of default by including them in the outstanding amount of the credit obligation at the moment of default in the numerator and denominator of the realised LGD. Where the fees were extended to the obligor in order to recover direct costs already incurred by the institution and these costs are already included in the calculation of the economic loss, institutions should not add these amounts to the economic loss or outstanding amount again. Any fees capitalised after the moment of default should not increase the amount of economic loss or amount outstanding at the moment of default. However, all recoveries, including those related to fees capitalised after default, should be included in the calculation of economic loss.

In the case of retail exposures, in accordance with Articles 181(2)(b) and 182(3) of this Regulation institutions may reflect future drawings either in their conversion factors or in their LGD estimates.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:84]
PARAGRAPH_96139: 144. For the purpose of the calculation of the realised LGDs, institutions should take into account all material direct and indirect cost related to the recovery process. Where any material direct or indirect costs relating to the collection on exposures and the default of the respective counterparty have been incurred before the moment of default institutions should include these costs in the LGD estimation unless at least one of the following conditions is met:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:85]
PARAGRAPH_96146: 46. Indirect costs should include all costs stemming from the running of the institution's recovery processes, overall costs of outsourced collection services not included as direct costs, and all other costs related to the collection on defaulted exposures that cannot be directly attributed to collection on a specific exposure. Institutions should include in their estimation of indirect costs an appropriate percentage of other ongoing costs, such as institutions' overheads related to the recovery processes, unless they can demonstrate that these costs are immaterial.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:85]
PARAGRAPH_96149: 147. The historical observation period should be as broad as possible and should contain data from various periods with differing economic circumstances. For this purpose institutions should at a minimum select a historical observation period in such a way that:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:85]
PARAGRAPH_96150: (a) the length of the historical observation period, i.e. the timespan between the oldest default considered in the RDS and the moment of the LGD estimation, covers at least the minimum length specified in Article 181(1)(j) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 for exposures to corporates, institutions, central governments and central banks and, for retail exposures, the period specified in Article 181(2) subparagraph 2 of that Regulation and, where applicable, Commission Delegated Regulation adopting technical standards laid down in Article 181(3)(b) of that Regulation;

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:86] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_96160: 49. In accordance with letter (a) of Article 181(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 institutions are required to calculate the long-run average LGD separately for each facility grade or pool. In this context institutions should calculate the long-run average LGD also at the level of the portfolio covered by the LGD model. In the calculation of long-run average LGD institutions should use all defaults observed in the historical observation period that fall within the scope of the LGD model.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:86]
PARAGRAPH_96161: 150. Without prejudice to Article 181(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 institutions should calculate the long-run average LGD as an arithmetic average of realised LGDs over a historical observation period weighted by a number of defaults. Institutions should not use for that purpose any averages of LGDs calculated on a subset of observations, in particular any yearly average LGDs, unless they use this method to reflect higher weights of more recent data on retail exposures in accordance with Article 181(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:86]
PARAGRAPH_96162: 151. Where institutions do not give equal importance to all historical data for retail exposures in accordance with Article 181(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 they should be able to demonstrate in a documented manner that the use of higher weights for more recent data is justified by better prediction of loss rates. In particular where zero or very small weights are applied to specific periods this should be duly justified or lead to more conservative estimates.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:86]
PARAGRAPH_96163: 152. In specifying the weights in accordance with paragraph 151 institutions should take into account the representativeness of data assessed in accordance with section 4.2.4 as well as the economic and market conditions that are represented by the data.

PARAGRAPH_96165: 153. For the purposes of letter (a) of Article 181(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, in relation to the use of all defaults observed during the historical observation period within the data sources for LGD estimation, institutions should ensure that the relevant information from incomplete recovery processes is taken into account in a conservative manner. The LGD estimation should be based on the long-run average LGD.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:86]
PARAGRAPH_96166: 154. Institutions should calculate the observed average LGD for each facility grade or pool and at the level of the portfolio covered by the LGD model taking into account realised LGDs on all defaults observed in the historical observation period related to closed recovery processes in accordance with paragraphs 155 to 157 without including any expected future recoveries. The observed average LGD should be weighted by the number of defaults included in the calculation.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:87]
PARAGRAPH_96170: 155. Institutions should clearly specify in their internal policies the moment of closing the recovery processes. All recovery processes that have been closed should be treated as such for the purpose of the calculation of the observed average LGD.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:87]
PARAGRAPH_96171: 156. Institutions should define the maximum period of the recovery process for a given type of exposures from the moment of default that reflects the expected period of time observed on the closed recovery processes during which the institution realises the vast majority of the recoveries, without taking into account the outlier observations with significantly longer recovery processes. The maximum period of the recovery processes should be specified in a way that ensures sufficient data for the estimation of the recoveries within this period for the incomplete recovery processes. The length of the maximum period of the recovery processes may be different for different types of exposures. The specification of the maximum period of the recovery process should be clearly documented and supported by evidence of the observed recovery patterns, and should be coherent with the nature of the transactions and the type of exposures. Specification of the maximum period of the recovery process for the purpose of the long-run average LGD should not prevent institutions from taking recovery actions where necessary, even with regard to exposures which remain in default for a period of time longer than the maximum period of the recovery process specified for this type of exposures.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:87]
PARAGRAPH_96172: 157. For the purpose of the calculation of the observed average LGD, institutions should recognise without undue delay as closed recovery processes all exposures in default which fall into at least one of the following categories:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:87]
PARAGRAPH_96173: (a) exposures for which the institution does not expect to take any further recovery actions;

PARAGRAPH_96177: With regard to the defaulted exposures falling under the categories in points (a) and (b), all recoveries and costs realised before or at the time of estimation should be considered for the purpose of the calculation of the observed average LGD, including any recoveries realised after the maximum period of the recovery processes.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:87] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_96178: 158. Institutions should obtain the long-run average LGD by adjusting the observed average LGD taking into account the information related to processes that were not closed ('incomplete recovery processes') and where the time from the moment of default until the moment of estimation is shorter than the maximum period of the recovery process specified for this type of exposures. For these processes, institutions should comply with both of the following:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:89]
PARAGRAPH_96201: 161. Institutions should calibrate their LGD estimates to the long run average LGD calculated in accordance with section 6.3.2. For this purpose institutions should choose a calibration method that is appropriate for their LGD estimation methodology from the following approaches:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:89]
PARAGRAPH_96202: (a) the calibration of LGD estimates to the long-run average LGD calculated for each grade or pool, in which case they should provide additional calibration tests at the level of the relevant calibration segment;

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:89]
PARAGRAPH_96203: (b) the calibration of LGD estimates to the long-run average LGD calculated at the level of calibration segment, in particular where they use direct LGD estimates in accordance with Article 169(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, including where they use LGD estimation methodology based on intermediate parameters. In this case institutions should at least compare this long-run average LGD with the average LGD estimate applied to the same set of observations as those used for calculating the long-run average LGD and, where necessary, correct the individual LGD estimates for the application portfolio accordingly, for instance by using a scaling factor. Where realised values are higher than estimated values at the level of calibration segment, institutions should correct the estimates upwards or readjust their estimation in order to reflect their loss experience.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:89]
PARAGRAPH_96204: 162. Where institutions observe extremely high values of realised LGDs much above 100%, especially for exposures with small outstanding amounts at the moment of default, they should identify relevant risk drivers to differentiate these observations and adequately reflect these specific characteristics in the assignment to grades or pool. Where institutions use a continuous rating scale in the LGD estimation, they may create a separate calibration segment for such exposures.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:89] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_96205: 163. In order to comply with the requirement of Article 181(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 to use all observed defaults in LGD quantification, institutions should not exclude any defaults observed in the historical observation period that fall within the scope of application of the LGD model.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:89]
PARAGRAPH_96206: 164. In the analysis of the representativeness of data in accordance with section 4.2.4, institutions should take into account not only the current characteristics of the portfolio but also, where relevant, the changes to the structure of the portfolio that are expected to happen in the foreseeable future due to specific actions or decisions that have already been taken. Adjustments made on the basis of the changes expected in the foreseeable future should not lead to a decrease in the estimates of LGD parameter.

For the purposes of taking into account the information on the time in-default and recoveries realised so far, in accordance with Article 54(2)(b) of the RTS on IRB assessment methodology institutions may take into account this information either directly as risk drivers or indirectly, for instance by setting the reference date for estimation, as referred to in paragraphs 171 to 174.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:92]
PARAGRAPH_96242: 177. For the purpose of ELBE and LGD in-default estimation, institutions should analyse the potential risk drivers referred to in paragraph 121 not only until the moment of default but also after the date of default and until the date of termination of the recovery process. Institutions should analyse also other potential risk drivers that might become relevant after the date of default, including in particular the expected length of the recovery process and the status of the recovery process. Institutions should use the values of risk drivers as well as the values of collateral adequate to the reference dates specified in accordance with paragraphs 171 to 174.

PARAGRAPH_96245: 178. . For the purposes of ELBE and LGD in-default estimation, institutions should calculate the realised LGDs for defaulted exposures, in accordance with section 6.3.1 with the only difference that this should be done with regard to each of the reference dates specified in accordance with paragraphs 171 to 174, rather than the date of default. In the calculation of the realised LGD at a given reference date institutions should include all fees and interest capitalised before the reference date and they should discount all subsequent cash flows and drawings to the reference date.

PARAGRAPH_96246: 179. Where, after the moment of default, institutions write-off part of the exposure the calculation of the economic loss and the realised LGD should be based on the full amount of the outstanding credit obligation, without taking into account the partial write-off. However, where institutions regularly write-off parts of exposures based on a consistent policy in terms of the time and proportion of the write-off, they may include this information in the calibration of final ELBE and LGD in-default. Where institutions perform write-offs in a less regular manner, they may reflect the information about the partial write-off of a specific exposure in the application of these parameters to this exposure by overriding the output of the rating assignment process in accordance with section 8.2 in order to ensure consistency between the LGD estimation and the application of the LGD estimates.

PARAGRAPH_96256: 33. For the purposes of considering current economic circumstances in their ELBE estimates, as required by Article 181(1)(h) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should take into account economic factors, including macroeconomic and credit factors, relevant for the type of exposures under consideration.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:93]
PARAGRAPH_96257: 84. The ELBE should be estimated on the basis of the long-run average LGD, referred to in paragraph 180 and no further adjustments to reflect current economic conditions should be performed where any of the following conditions is met:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:94] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_96266: 186. Where the model used for credit risk adjustments satisfies or can be adjusted to satisfy the requirements for own-LGD estimates set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3, Section 6 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions may use specific credit risk adjustments as ELBE estimates.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:94] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_96267: 187. Where specific credit risk adjustments are assessed individually for a single exposure or a single obligor, institutions may override the ELBE estimates based on specific credit risk adjustments, where they are able to prove that this would improve the accuracy of the ELBE estimates and that the specific credit risk adjustments reflect or are adjusted to the requirements set in section 6.3.1 on the calculation of economic loss.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:94] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_96268: 188. For the purposes of justifying situations where the specific credit risk adjustments exceed the ELBE estimates in accordance with Article 54(2)(f) of the RTS on IRB assessment methodology, institutions should ensure consistency of the ELBE estimates with the economic loss components described in section 6.3.1 as well as with the definition of default set out in Article 178 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and analyse any differences in that regard from the definitions and methods used for the purpose of determining specific credit risk adjustments. In particular, institutions should take into account, the possible differences in the discounting rate, the presence of collateral that is not eligible under Article 181(1)(f) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, different treatments of costs and the application of different definitions of default.

PARAGRAPH_96270: 189. For the purpose of considering the possible adverse change in economic conditions during the expected length of the recovery processes referred to in Article 54(2)(a) of the RTS on IRB assessment methodology the LGD in-default should reflect at least downturn conditions, where the estimates of LGD in-default that are appropriate for an economic downturn are more conservative than the long-run average LGD for defaulted exposures, referred to in paragraph 180.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:94] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_96271: 190. For the purpose of Article 181(1)(h) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 the LGD in-default should be increased above the level referred to in paragraph 189 where this is necessary to ensure that the difference between the LGD in-default and the ELBE covers for any increase of loss rate caused by possible additional unexpected losses during the recovery period.

PARAGRAPH_96292: 195. For the purpose of Article 171(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 institutions should apply additional conservatism to the outcomes of the rating assignment where any deficiencies are identified related to the implementation of the model in the IT system or to the process of assignment of risk parameters to obligors or facilities in the current portfolio (application of risk parameters), especially when those deficiencies relate to data used in the rating assignment process.

For the purpose of paragraph 195(b) institutions should ensure that the occurrence of any of the triggers referred to in paragraph 196 results in the application of additional conservatism to the risk parameter for the purpose of the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts. Where more than one trigger occurs, the estimate should be more conservative. The additional conservatism related to each trigger should be proportionate to the uncertainty in the estimated risk parameter introduced by the trigger.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:97] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_96306: 198.

PARAGRAPH_96318: 203. For the purpose of Article 172(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 institutions should specify the policies and criteria for the use of overrides in the rating assignment process. These policies should refer both to possible overrides of inputs and outputs of such process and should be specified in a conservative manner such that the scale of conservative overrides should not be limited. In contrast, the scale of potential decreases of the estimates resulting from the model, either by overriding the inputs or outputs of the rating assignment process, should be limited. In applying the overrides institutions should take into account all relevant and up-to-date information.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:98]
PARAGRAPH_96319: 204. Institutions should document the scale and rationale of each override. Wherever possible institutions should specify a predefined list of possible justifications of the overrides to choose from.

PARAGRAPH_96387: The EBA considers it adequate to provide an impact assessment which analyses 'the potential related costs and benefits' of the policy provided in the GL. This analysis provides the reader with an overview of the findings as regards problem identification, options identified to remove problems and their potential impacts.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:103]
PARAGRAPH_96388: The following analysis consists basically of three parts, where the baseline scenario in terms of current practices and supervisory expectations starts from the analysis performed for the purpose of the reports on comparability and pro-cyclicality of capital requirements published by the EBA in December 2013. In terms of the regulatory environment, the baseline scenario is set out by the GL specified by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) in 2006 (GL 10), under the assumption that this guidance has been followed by institutions when developing their risk parameter estimation methodologies. The second part contains the options considered with respect to the major policy decisions that have been analysed and discussed in the finalisation of these GL. Finally, the draft cost-benefit analysis is based on the main policy changes in comparison with the currently applicable GL 10.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:103] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_96389: For the second part of this analysis, i.e. the options considered, a reference is included to the Report on the IRB modelling practices, which contains the impact assessment for the GLs on PD, LGD and the treatment of defaulted exposures based on the IRB survey results. Shortly after the publication of the Consultation Paper (CP) of these GLs, the EBA conducted a qualitative survey on institution's current modelling practices (i.e. the IRB survey) on several of the policy choices addressed in these GL. A summary of the responses to this IRB survey will be published together with these GL. Given that the distribution of current modelling practices stemming from the IRB survey has been taken into account in several of the policy choices in these GL, the impact assessment, i.e. the analysis of the pros and cons of the policy options considered, is also presented in that report. Accordingly, the report is a joint report on the impact assessment for the GL and the results of the IRB survey. In order not to duplicate these analyses, in section D below (Options considered), the reader is referred to the relevant sections in the Report on the IRB modelling practices.

PARAGRAPH_96397: The objective of the GL is to establish convergence of institutions' and supervisory definitions related to PD and LGD estimation and the treatment of defaulted assets, as well as the convergence of institutions' methodological choices in developing PD and LGD models where these choices are considered to be drivers of unjustified RWA variability. The GL are complementary to the RTS on IRB assessment methodology (EBA/RTS/2016/03) where some technical choices related to PD and LGD estimation, as well as to the treatment of defaulted assets, are already regulated. In particular, provisions related to data requirements, the estimation of the long-run average PD and the calculation of the long-run average LGD as a simple average with respect to the number of defaults refer to the RTS on IRB assessment methodology as a starting point.

PARAGRAPH_96420: In general, most competent authorities (CAs) confirm the requirement that conservatism should be applied for data and model issues, and none of the CAs provides guidance on the level of conservatism that is expected. Given this, the adequacy of the level of conservatism is mainly assessed on a case-by-case basis, and fewer than 30% of CAs have rules on this topic, most being non-public. These rules concern the following aspects: (i) one CA requires that a MoC be applied for low default portfolio models and for models primarily based on human judgement; (ii) one CA requires an explicit statistical approach to assess the MoC, combined with a qualitative adjustment when the defaults are fewer than 20; (iii) one CA requires that conservatism be applied to address the 'seasonal peak' for mortgages; (iv) another mentions that a non- compliant definition of default should be addressed by a MoC; (v) another mentions that institutions should have a methodology to assess the MoC, taking into account the results of the validation and the results of self- assessment; and finally (vi) one CA mentions that a supervisory add-on will compensate for institutions' lack of conservatism.

PARAGRAPH_96423: One third of the CAs specify rules concerning the PD estimation approach, almost all non-public. In general, the use of internal default rates or statistical approaches is promoted or requested as long as the data are relevant and representative. For low default portfolios, the mapping with external rating or expert models is usually tolerated, but (i) with the use of an additional level of conservatism, or (ii) where benchmarking should be performed with other approaches, and where the institutions are encouraged to collect data to develop statistical models in due time. Some CAs, however, allow all approaches without restriction.

PARAGRAPH_96432: Approximately one third of CAs have rules on this topic, most being non-public and general, in the sense that the most relevant variables should be included in the model and missing variables are challenged. In two Member States, there is a requirement that there should be risk drivers or rating criteria on some key groups of variables (such as characteristics of the borrower, terms of the transaction, collateral, unpaid amounts, etc). When it comes to assessing the information value of the risk drivers, some Member States specify a threshold for the p-value of the regression, whereas others specify more general rules regarding the adequacy of the discriminatory power.

PARAGRAPH_96434: More than 40% of CAs have rules concerning the number of grades, which are usually public and binding. The majority stick to the minimum number of grades fixed by the CRD (seven plus default); one CA increases the number to 10 for wholesale portfolios. Related rules in some Member States require that the number of pools and grades should be high enough to allow adequate quantification and validation. In one Member State, the concentration across the rating scale should be assessed by the Hirschman-Herfindahl index. In another Member State, the concentration in one grade should not be greater than 30% unless the grade covers a reasonably narrow PD band. Another CA applies a 25% limit for the wholesale portfolios. These rules, however, do not apply to low default portfolios, where a case-by- case approach is typically allowed.

PARAGRAPH_96436: Very few CAs appeared to have rules on this topic, mostly non-public, and only one CA publicly requires ratings to be TTC. One CA explicitly assesses the stability of the ratings, and another specifically allows hybrid systems.

However, only three CAs reported rules on the topic, all non-public.

PARAGRAPH_96443: Around one third of the Member States have rules on this topic, some being public and binding, and some non- public. These rules usually mention the requirement of five years of representative data. When a shorter period is used, a MoC must usually be added to address the data issue. The answers appeared incomplete for several CAS, however, and therefore no robust conclusions could be drawn.

PARAGRAPH_96446: The majority of Member States do not have any specific rules with regard to estimation methodologies other than those specified in GL 10, but it was indicated by several respondents that workout LGD is mostly (or even solely) in use. Only in two jurisdictions were there public and binding rules in that regard, where workout LGD was prescribed in one jurisdiction - for mortgage portfolios, and in the other workout LGD was expected for corporate and retail portfolios, while market LGD was allowed for large corporate, institutions and sovereign exposures. A few Member States apply certain rules with regard to cure rates: one of them explicitly requires institutions to identify cure rates, and another imposes such a requirement where there is potentially a higher rate of technical defaults. In any case, the definition of cure is left for the institutions to specify.

PARAGRAPH_96448: Only a few Member States have any specific rules with regard to the calculation of economic loss and realised LGD and most of them are not public and cover only selected aspects, such as conservative approach to cost calculation and allocation. One of the CAs defined minimum types of data to be collected by the institution for the purpose of calculation of realised LGD while another specified that, in cases of collateral repossession, institutions have to estimate haircuts on the value of the collateral, taking into account the potential sale value and the time to sale.

In addition, one CA requires institutions to take into account at least two complete recovery cycles. With regard to the treatment of incomplete cases, most of the Member States do not have any specific rules. Those few that do have such rules require including such cases in the calculation, and allow estimation of future cash flows.

Institutions are required to ensure adequate segmentation within each portfolio to ensure a proper risk differentiation. More rules exist with regard to explanatory variables; in three jurisdictions such rules are public and binding, whereas in six others they are not public but are part of supervisory practices. While in some cases the rules refer to certain risk drivers that have to be used in model development, other CAs require that banks use the most relevant variables and that they adequately reflect the recovery processes.

Other requirements specified by individual Member States include the following: (i) covering a complete business cycle; or (ii) covering at least two complete recovery cycles. In a few cases different weighting is allowed, for instance to address structural changes in data, but such weighting has to be sufficiently justified and conservatism has to be ensured.

Examples of such rules include the following: (i) estimates have to be made for homogeneous pools of collateral, where similar recoveries can be expected and shown; (ii) foreign exchange risk must be considered; (iii) banks must establish internal standards for collateral management, consistent with those required under the Standardised Approach. With regard to valuation, there are various requirements across jurisdictions, which range from requiring that the valuation of real estate collateral be performed by an independent appraiser to allowing the use of statistical methods in determining the value of the real estate. In some cases, CAs required the application of haircuts, which are specified differently by different Member States. In addition, a few CAs specified rules with regard to minimum frequency of revaluations, which again differ across jurisdictions. While one CA requires annual reviews for real estate collaterals, and quarterly reviews for financial collaterals, others allow less frequent revaluations, at least in some cases.

In one Member State, it is required that MoC should be applied on top of the estimates, and another specifies that MoC can be established as an LGD floor (e.g. 45% in the case of large corporates) or specific add-ons (e.g. stressing the probability of incompletes).

PARAGRAPH_96524: The guidance given in these GL regarding the development and maintenance of risk parameter estimation methodologies, as well as regarding the treatment of defaulted assets, will affect all areas of modelling PD, LGD, ELBE and LGD in-default. Therefore it is expected that these GL will lead to model changes. For each individual policy aspect, the Report on IRB modelling practices contains an overview of the proportion of models (and the proportion of exposures covered by these models) for which the policy chosen in the GL will imply a change in practice (see section 4.10. for PD estimation, section 5.8. for LGD non-defaulted, section 6.6 for LGD in-default and ELBE estimation). For most policy choices, the policy chosen in the GL represents the most common approach. This should ensure that the number of model changes is minimal, to the extent possible, since other (economic) arguments have also been taken into account in the final policy choices in the GL. The Report on IRB modelling practices also contains an overview of the number of aspects which will need to be changed in PD, LGD non-defaulted, LGD in-default and ELBE estimation. From these results, it can be noted that the proportion of models which are already compliant with the GL, i.e. the proportion of models for which no model changes would be required, is very small (8% for PD, 1% for LGD non-defaulted, 4% for LGD in-default and 6% for ELBE models). Given that these computations include only a minimum list of policy aspects (i.e. those for which a clear split can be made between models that would comply and those that would not comply), the above numbers are a lower bound to the true expected number of model changes. It is therefore safe to say that all models will probably need to be adjusted, in one way or another.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:113]
PARAGRAPH_96539: a. Discounting factor - like GL 10, the GL are based on the principle that discounting rate should include risk-free rate and risk premium, but propose a fixed value of the risk premium; there is no possibility for institutions to estimate this premium themselves for specific portfolios. The GL are less flexible with regard to how the uncertainty should be addressed and suggest that it is no longer possible to include this uncertainty elsewhere, for instance in the recovery cash flows, instead of the discounting factor.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:113]
PARAGRAPH_96540: Currently institutions use various approaches for determining the discounting rate, ranging from the use of discounting factors based on effective interest rates of the underlying loans, and various add-ons with a wide range of values on top of various underlying internal and external interest rate benchmarks, to fixed discounting rates reflecting downturn conditions. In the light of these differences, it is expected that the policy decisions included in the GL may have a significant impact on the calculation of the realised LGDs for at least some of the institutions.

PARAGRAPH_96545: b. Recovery processes with positive outcome - GL 10 recognise that some defaulted positions may generate no loss, or may even have positive outcomes in the recovery process, and specify that the estimated LGD used to calculate capital requirements must not be less than zero. However, GL 10 do not prescribe any specific treatment of individual positive realised LGDs, other than that these cases should be monitored. The GL introduce the rule that realised LGDs should be floored to zero at individual level.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:114]
PARAGRAPH_96546: It is expected that this policy should not have significant impact on the LGD estimates in general, as these estimates have to reflect downturn conditions. The evidence collected in the IRB survey supports this, and shows that a zero floor at the level of the individual default observation is applied in 73% of LGD models. However, for some specific portfolios that may systematically lead to positive outcomes, such as certain leasing portfolios, this proposal may lead to a significant change of the model.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:114]
PARAGRAPH_96547: c. LGD estimation methodologies - GL 10 specify that the market LGD and implied market LGD, which are based on market data on the prices of certain instruments, are possible methodologies for estimating LGD in certain cases, especially where internal data is not sufficient, and capital markets are deep and liquid. However, it was also already recognised in GL 10 that these methods could potentially be used only in specific circumstances, and that LGD estimates based on an institution's own loss and recovery experience (the so called workout LGD) should in principle be superior to other types of estimates. According to the GL, methodologies based purely on market data will no longer be allowed, as these methodologies do not meet certain CRR requirements, in particular those related to the specification of the observation period and the representativeness of data. Market data may be used only to supplement internal data that reflects the institution's own experience.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:114]
PARAGRAPH_96548: In the light of the most recent proposals of the BCBS with regard to low default portfolios, and in particular the proposals for limiting the scope of application of the IRB Approach and LGD modelling, it is expected that the impact of the GL by the date of their application should not be significant. It seems that market-based methodologies are not widely used across the EU: among the institutions that participated in the IRB survey, it appears that only 8% have LGD models that are market based. For the LGD models in the sample of the IRB survey, the proportion of market implied LGD models for non-defaulted exposures is 2% (representing 4% of the exposure values).

PARAGRAPH_96560: Views of the Banking Stakeholder Group (BSG)

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:116]
PARAGRAPH_96561: The BSG generally supported the content of the draft GL, although a number of specific comments were raised. The BSG expressed support for the EBA's view that the existing risk-based (IRB) approach to measuring capital requirements has to be an integral part of the regulatory capital framework, stressing the need for risk sensitivity in capital requirements. The group also agreed, however, that the current flexibility in the IRB-framework has made comparability of capital requirements across institutions and jurisdictions difficult, and hence that there is a need for harmonisation of how models are developed and calibrated. The BSG was of the opinion that, in general, the draft GL did not specify in detail all of the requirements and definitions, and hence more clarifications would be welcome regarding key concepts in the final version of the GL. It was noted that the draft GL focused on high default portfolios, and clarifications were requested regarding the treatment of low default portfolios. It was also suggested that no potential BCBC decisions should be pre-empted by the GL.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:116] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_96562: Furthermore, the BSG underlined the need for increased transparency in relation to the IRB models, as this would contribute to enhancing trust in the models. In this context, it was suggested that institutions should disclose their general model concept in combination with a standardised validation test. Finally, increased harmonisation of the internal models and enhanced transparency should go hand in hand with strict procedures for authorisation and diligent supervision of the use of internal models by competent authorities.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:116]
PARAGRAPH_96563: While welcoming the harmonisation efforts, the BSG also mentioned that sufficient time should be granted for the implementation of the changes stemming from the GL, taking into account the time needed for assessment by competent authorities. In this context, a transitional grand fathering of existing models was suggested.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:116]
PARAGRAPH_96564: The BSG expressed concerns about the potential overall increase of capital requirements as a result of implementation of the GL. It was suggested that the impact should be carefully assessed to avoid unintended consequences. In this context additional clarifications were requested with regard to the application of the MoC to the risk parameters. Other specific comments related to the potential additional unexpected losses in the estimation of LGD in-default, the treatment of portfolio sales and the discounting rate.

PARAGRAPH_96575: As the CP included 25 specific questions, the industry provided detailed feedback on the draft GL. There was general support for the GL, and in particular for the EBA's efforts to harmonise the main concepts underlying the modelling practices to ensure comparability of risk parameters, while at the same time preserving risk sensitivity in the own funds requirements. It was also clear, however, that the implementation of the changes will require sufficient time, and a phased-in approach was suggested. This aspect has already been considered by the EBA and previously consulted on with the industry. The conclusions were reflected in the EBA's Opinion on the implementation of the regulatory review of the IRB Approach (EBA/Op/2016/01), published in February 201613. The date of application of the GL was specified in accordance with this Opinion so the GL will apply from 1 January 2021, which in the EBA's view gives sufficient time for institutions and competent authorities to implement and assess the changes to the rating systems.

The EBA considered this aspect and decided that no specific rules should be specified for low default portfolios, as in this case the minimum requirements must also be met to receive permission to use the IRB Approach, and the CRR does not envisage any exemptions from these requirements for such portfolios. The requirements of the GL have been specified in a flexible manner, to accommodate various estimation methodologies and types of portfolios. Especially in the phase of model development, institutions may use data and methods that are considered most appropriate for a given portfolio. While human judgement is an integral element of all

PARAGRAPH_96582: Nearly all respondents commented on the concept of MoC included in the draft GL. While many respondents expressed general support for the proposal, the majority expressed operational concerns, especially regarding the quantification and aggregation of MoC relating to different identified deficiencies and categories. The aspect of low default portfolios was also mentioned in the context of potentially higher MoC due to lower data availability. It was considered counterintuitive that greater conservatism would have to be applied to less risky portfolios. The EBA has carefully considered the feedback received and adjusted the concept of MoC by simplifying the aspects of categorisation, quantification and aggregation, and by providing additional clarifications where necessary.

PARAGRAPH_96583: While there was broad agreement with the requirements specified for the estimation of risk parameters, many specific comments were expressed, especially in the context of LGD estimation. These included in particular aspects such as representativeness of data, treatment of interest and fees after default, discounting rate, and treatment of incomplete recovery processes. The feedback received was to a large extent included in the final text of the GL. In particular, more detailed clarifications were provided with regard to data representativeness, making a clear distinction between the phase of model development and calibration, as well as alignment between PD and LGD estimation. More detailed feedback with regard to these and other comments is provided in the table below.

Potential difficulties in the application of the GL to low-default portfolios were mentioned in particular in the context of MoC, in that higher MoC would apply to less risky portfolios due to more limited data availability.

Therefore, the GL could not include any specific rules applicable to these types of exposures. However, the requirements of the GL have been specified in a flexible manner in order to accommodate various estimation methodologies and types of portfolios. In particular during the model development phase, institutions may use the data and methods that are considered most appropriate for a given portfolio. While human judgement is an integral element of all models, it is expected that in the case of models for low-default portfolios it may be used to a relatively large extent.

PARAGRAPH_96634: The EBA has followed closely developments with regard to the Basel reforms and has tried to avoid any inconsistencies. These GL will be complementary to the revised Basel framework and will apply to all models that remain within the scope of the IRB Approach. Full consistency with accounting standards is not possible due to the different objectives of accounting and prudential frameworks, and some differences are inevitable (e.g. downturn versus current economic conditions, or the time horizon of the parameters). However, as accounting standards are more principle-based, modelling for accounting purposes can leverage on rules set out for prudential purposes.

PARAGRAPH_96647: A few respondents noted that the GL do not address the estimation of conversion factors and asked about the EBA's intentions in that regard. It was also not clear whether the GL would apply to the slotting criteria approach for specialised lending. Furthermore, one respondent suggested that it should be clarified throughout the GL which requirements are general and which apply only to specific exposure classes (retail/non-retail).

PARAGRAPH_96648: Indeed the GL do not cover the estimation of conversion factors, and currently there are no plans to provide additional guidance in that regard; however, it cannot be excluded in the future. As the slotting criteria approach is considered a type of rating system, the GL apply to this approach, but only to the extent to which they are relevant. As the approach does not include the quantification of risk parameters, the requirements for risk quantification will not be applicable. Where the GL do not specify explicitly the scope of application of a certain requirement, it means that the requirement is relevant for all models across all exposure classes.

PARAGRAPH_96672: One respondent wondered whether the categories and examples included in the background and rationale section of the CP should be seen as a checklist of potential triggers of MoC, in the sense that the potential outcome for an institution may be a zero MoC for certain triggers. One respondent agreed that this should be the case, but another respondent argued that such a checklist would be strictly interpreted by supervisors as requiring an MoC for each individual category. This respondent disagreed with this annex.

PARAGRAPH_96673: Due to the confusion about the nature of the list of triggers of MoC in the background and rationale section of the CP, the list has been removed from the final GL. Due to the specificities of triggers of MoC, it is deemed more appropriate to allow institutions to specify a list of all identified deficiencies along with the categories in which they are classified, without including in the GL an example of what such list of triggers might look like. Nevertheless, the GL do contain a non-exhaustive list of triggers of MoC, which institutions should analyse under the relevant categories. Institutions should also create for each rating system a complete list of

PARAGRAPH_96683: Whereas several respondents welcomed the clarification of the MoC and adjustment framework set out in the GL, many raised concerns with respect to the practical feasibility of quantifying all MoCs for the individual categories. Some also mentioned that institutions currently already include adjustments and MoC in their estimations. Some respondents wondered whether the benefits of the proposed framework outweighed the costs. One bank argued that it would be operationally difficult to implement this framework by end-2020. One respondent argued that an MoC should only be applied as a last-resort measure, and that other ways to address a deficiency should be explored first. One respondent argued that the MoC framework introduced judgement and subjectivity, which comes at the expense of risk sensitivity.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:124]
PARAGRAPH_96684: Based on this feedback, it has been decided to construct a different list of categories, which should facilitate the quantification of MoC by category, so that overlaps between triggers of MoC in different categories can be avoided. The new categories to be identified are the following: category A - MOC related to data and methodological deficiencies; category B - MoC related to relevant changes to underwriting standards, risk appetite, collection and recovery policies, and any other source of additional uncertainty; category C - general estimation error. The GL contain a non-exhaustive list of deficiencies that would fall into categories A and B.

PARAGRAPH_96687: Although the EBA considered specifying how MoC should be quantified, it has been taken into account that a wide variety of practices exists, which corresponds to the different possible natures of the potential deficiencies and uncertainties. Therefore, the preferred approach, taken in the GL, is to specify a list of minimum conditions for the quantification of MoCs in each category, without prescribing a detailed methodology. As regards the clarification of the scope of MoC, it should be mentioned that an MoC should cover at least the expected range of

It was mentioned that the differences between categories A, B, C and D were not clear. It was also suggested that further standardisation of the criteria for the adjustments and MoC identification and quantification should be provided. For some respondents, it was mainly category C that was unclear. Some mentioned that, without this clarification, the MoC framework would lead to even less comparable estimates among banks.

Note that paragraph 38 of the final GL contains a non-exhaustive list of potential deficiencies that should be analysed.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:127]
PARAGRAPH_96730: Many respondents argued that it would be overly cumbersome to require an MoC for each and every trigger or deficiency. Some respondents argued that a proportional treatment (e.g. a materiality threshold) should be applied if an MoC has only a small impact on PD or LGD levels. One respondent argued that it should be allowable to set an MoC for each category in a harmonised manner for less material models. One respondent, furthermore, argued that it would be inappropriate to apply an adjustment and an MoC in the event that some data in the development sample were erroneous or not representative, and that in such a case it would be better to exclude these data from the development dataset.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:127]
PARAGRAPH_96731: As the CRR requires that an MoC is included in risk parameters, covering the expected range of estimation errors and other sources of uncertainty, this requirement cannot be disregarded and hence institutions should identify all possible deficiencies. However, it is not necessary for an MoC to be quantified for each deficiency separately. The GL specify that institutions should quantify an MoC at least for each of the categories A, B and C at the level of the calibration segment, by taking into account the requirement specified in section 4.4.3. Within each of the categories A and B, identified deficiencies of a similar nature may be grouped and the quantification of MoC may be carried out on an aggregated basis.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:127]
PARAGRAPH_96733: Several respondents argued that it would be difficult and burdensome to classify and quantify MoCs, as required, into the four categories specified. It was argued that it would be impractical to break down adjustments and MoCs into individual components. Some respondents argued that the whole framework was too detailed and requested a more principle-based approach. Some respondents argued that the proposed framework would entail a significant operational burden.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:127]
PARAGRAPH_96734: Taking into account the feedback received, the proposed MoC framework has been redesigned and the number of categories has been reduced to three simplified and non-overlapping categories. Further simplifications were not considered appropriate, as the implementation of this framework is necessary in order to reduce the unjustified RWA variability stemming from MoC. Furthermore, it should be noted that the framework for quantifying adjustments and MoCs at category level is only principle-based, and the quantification methodology should be appropriate to the nature of the identified deficiencies.

PARAGRAPH_96743: Some respondents expressed concerns about the wording 'rank order estimation error' in paragraph 25(c)(i) of the CP on the GL. One respondent suggested replacing 'the rank order estimation error' with 'rank ordering errors that lead to distorted capital requirements', because an institution could misclassify certain exposures, but, due to the very high separation power of the model, there would be no distortion in capital requirements. Another respondent wondered about the distinction between this deficiency and estimation error in the calibration. One respondent suggested changing the wording to 'rank order estimation error leading to inappropriate calibration on portfolio, calibration segment or rating grade level'.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:128]
PARAGRAPH_96744: The reference to 'rank order estimation error' has been deleted from the final GL. Instead, it has been clarified that, while data and methodological deficiencies in the model development should be identified, they should be covered by MoC to the extent that they lead to bias in the quantification of risk parameters or to increased uncertainty that is not fully captured by general estimation error.

Some respondents wondered how the estimation should be done, i.e. whether they should estimate the parameter with and without the corrected data, but they argued that this would be very burdensome and time-consuming. One respondent pointed out that this requirement was problematic in relation to the requirement in paragraph 81, which requires institutions to conduct the calibration before the application of MoCs. Another respondent argued that the requirement would be inconsistent with IFRS 9 rules, which

PARAGRAPH_96748: As regards the quantification of the MoC, the final GL do not prescribe a set methodology, given that the range of possible deficiencies is so diverse. The GL do, however, include more details on the conditions that should be met for the quantification. A clear separation has been introduced between appropriate adjustments and MoC (i.e. MoC should be added to best estimates of risk parameters). This also allows the calibration to be performed before the application of MoC (and PD floors). The GL further require that the total MoC at parameter level should be derived as the sum of the MoCs of the individual categories A, B and C.

It was also argued that the identified errors should be limited to categories A and B, and that category C would be more relevant to the monitoring process. Others argued that category C could only be integrated into model development or used as an adjustment in the calibration, and that it should therefore be removed. Some respondents argued that there would be an overlap between MoC and model risk (category C), or that a potential overlap effect could result from applying several conservative adjustments. Another respondent warned of a potential overlap between MoCs introduced in model development and those introduced in model application. Some argued that it should be allowable to apply a zero MoC if the institution can demonstrate that the deficiency itself leads to a conservative outcome. Others did not see the value of category D, as it was an open- ended category.

PARAGRAPH_96759: The potential overlaps between the different categories that were proposed in the CP have been discussed and have led to a redesign of the categories (see above).

However, the assumption of the independence of MoCs related to these categories would be incorrect, as the appropriate adjustments that are made in relation to deficiencies stemming from categories A and B may influence general estimation error. Therefore, for the purpose of harmonisation and in order not to impose over-sophistication it has been decided to require the aggregation of the MoCs for the categories based on a simple sum. However, different aggregation techniques may be used within each of the categories. Here, institutions are allowed flexibility to address in an appropriate manner different types of deficiencies and their potential interrelations. All methods used for the quantification and aggregation of MoCs should be documented and regularly monitored.

Whenever possible, identified deficiencies should be rectified and MoC should not be used as a reason not to do so.

PARAGRAPH_96792: One respondent argued that the prescribed treatment for missing ratings was unclear with respect to the requirement that each and every natural or legal person that represents an IRB exposure should be rated. The respondent wondered whether these ratings should receive a specific PD calibration. The respondent suggested that these ratings be assigned to a conservative class that receives a specific PD calibration, and wondered whether this treatment would be consistent with the GL.

PARAGRAPH_96793: The GL specify that obligors with missing ratings should be assigned to a separate grade or pool for the purpose of the calculation of the one-year default rate (DR). As regards the question of whether a separate calibration is required for this grade or pool, it should be noted that this depends on the institution's practice in relation to calibration, according to the GL. In particular, such a separate calibration would be required if the institution performed calibration at grade or pool level, in which case additional calibration tests should be performed at portfolio level.

PARAGRAPH_96803: Some respondents requested clarification on the requirement to ensure that, if new information becomes available, it is integrated into the rating calculation in a timely manner and that a review of the rating assignment be made within three months after the information becomes available. One respondent wondered whether this requirement related only to the one-year DR calculation, or whether it should also include the revision of the rating grade, because, the respondent argued, this would be impossible for models that include a qualitative component. Another respondent wondered whether this referred to the cases of the default of a counterparty. Another respondent assumed that the three-month period would start from the day of publication of financial statement information, and pointed out that this three-month time- window would be particularly short for corporate exposures.

PARAGRAPH_96804: The EBA acknowledges that certain aspects of the requirement needed to be clarified, and has therefore redrafted this paragraph, differentiating clearly between the requirements that relate to any new information and those that relate to new information on the default of an obligor. Furthermore, the requirement that the new information should be incorporated within three months has been reconsidered and, to accommodate various circumstances, no specific deadlines are now defined. New information should be reflected in the relevant IT system as well as the resulting review of the rating or LGD assignment as soon as possible. When the new information relates to the default of an obligor, the PD of the obligor should be set to 1 in all relevant IT systems in a timely manner.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:133] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_96819: The GL mention that, where the one-year DR is calculated by grade or pool, the denominator should refer to all obligors assigned to a rating grade or pool at the beginning of the observation period with any credit obligation, excluding any substitution effects due to credit risk mitigation. Hence the GL are already clear that those persons or entities that do not have direct exposures but are rated only as providers of credit risk mitigation should be excluded from the calculation of one-year DR. In addition, it has been further explained in the background and rationale section that, where obligors whose obligations stem solely from non- credit products fall within the scope of application of the considered model and are treated in accordance with the institution's internal default definition, then they should form a separate pool in the rating system to avoid biasing the default rate of obligors with credit facilities. This requirement is necessary in order to ensure that PD estimates reflect the default risk of the obligor and are not biased by the different risk profiles of the protection providers, especially where limited information is available on the credit behaviour of the protection providers.

Therefore, whenever a credit obligation of an obligor is originated during the one- year observation period, that obligor will be included in the next one-year observation period. Depending on how frequently one-year default rates are calculated (at least quarterly, according to the final GL), it may therefore take a maximum of one quarter minus one day for such an obligor to be included in the subsequent one-year DR calculation. As regards the operational costs (i.e. IT costs) of ensuring that this information is available in the system, it is acknowledged that changing the IT system may entail costs; however, it is deemed that this information is necessary in order to ensure a harmonised and coherent DR calculation across institutions.

PARAGRAPH_96843: Two respondents mentioned that the provisions specifying the treatment of obligors that migrate to a different rating grade, pool or rating model, or obligors whose credit obligations have been sold, should be further clarified. One of the respondents argued that the rating of an obligor whose exposure has been sold is often not available after the sale. Another respondent pointed out the difficulties of including an obligor in the calculation if the obligor is no longer rated under the model at the time of default, and wondered what methods would be permitted for performing such an appropriate adjustment and add an MoC. In particular, the respondent argued that obligors that migrate or whose exposures are sold should be included in the denominator of the one-year DR only pro rata for the period during which they were included in the observation period.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:135] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_96844: It is specified in the GL that the calculation of the one-year default rate should take into account all obligors or exposures classified to a given grade or pool at the beginning of the one-year period, even if these exposures later migrate to different grade, were sold or were written off. The one-year default rate should be an objective measure calculated as set out in the GL. However, institutions should analyse whether migrations or sales of credit obligations lead to bias in the estimation of the PD and, if so, adjust this bias by applying an appropriate adjustment to the estimates and applying an MoC as specified in section 4.4 of the GL. The EBA acknowledges that there are different approaches to such adjustments, and, given that the appropriate adjustment will depend on the specific bias, these GL do not specify how this adjustment should be done in the event of bias. In any case, an appropriate adjustment should be documented and justified.

PARAGRAPH_96857: The majority of respondents stated either that they either already calculated the one-year DRs at a quarterly frequency, and therefore did not have any operational concerns regarding the requirement for quarterly monitoring, or that they usually calculated one-year default rates at least annually, and more often for some exposure classes, arguing that therefore the monitoring requirement would entail only a small operational burden. Some respondents stated that they usually calculated one-year default rates at least annually, and more often for some exposure classes, argued that it would generate significant costs and therefore stated that they would prefer this requirement to be removed. Some suggested having an annual review, but based on quarterly data. One respondent argued that the GL should specify that the quarterly calculation and monitoring of the one-year DR should coincide with the quarterly reporting dates of the institution. Several respondents requested additional clarification of the rationale for the quarterly monitoring requirement, or of what was meant by 'monitoring the appropriateness of the PD estimates'. One respondent assumed that this referred to a plausibility check of the default

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:136]
PARAGRAPH_96858: The requirement to calculate the one-year DR at least quarterly was included in the CP on the GL because this quarterly frequency allows an assessment of whether there have been any significant changes in the one-year DR within the one-year observation period, and therefore allows institutions to choose between overlapping and non- overlapping time windows when calculating the observed average DR, thereby avoiding potential biases that might stem from one of those calculation approaches. In order to clarify that this is the objective of this quarterly calculation frequency, this aspect has been included in the GL. Because the choice between overlapping and non-overlapping windows should be made when the observed average DR is to be recalculated, quarterly recalculation would not necessarily be an ongoing task, but would be required for the purpose of choosing and reviewing the appropriateness of an approach based on overlapping or non-overlapping windows. The EBA further acknowledges that a quarterly calculation frequency may be too restrictive for low- default portfolios, and hence the wording of this requirement has been softened in the final GL, which now require institutions only to 'evaluate the one- year DRs within the historical observation period at least quarterly'.

Another respondent assumed that it meant either (i) monitoring changes in default rates at a relevant level (portfolio, calibration segment and grade level) or (ii) monitoring the appropriateness of the calibration (but the latter would require a quarterly update of the long-run average DR). Respondents also wondered what conclusions should be drawn from these quarterly calculations. Some argued that the quarterly monitoring requirement was too much for low-default portfolios in which it is unlikely that there would be a significant difference in the one-year DR, or, if there was, this requirement would lead to unstable measurements. Respondents therefore proposed that institutions be given the option to apply annual monitoring if they are able to demonstrate that annual monitoring is appropriate due to a lack of new information on a quarterly basis.

In order to perform these additional calibration tests, the long-run average DR at grade or pool level as well as at the level of the relevant calibration segment should be available.

PARAGRAPH_96881: Several respondents expressed their agreement with the proposed approach to overlapping versus non-overlapping windows. Some respondents would favour a harmonisation measure that would allow only non-overlapping windows, because, they argued, this would be simpler and would allow more efficient management of multiple defaults. One respondent even proposed prescribing that these non- overlapping windows coincide with calendar years. One respondent would favour a harmonisation measure that would allow only overlapping windows. Some respondents argued that there could not be bias due to the use of overlapping versus non- overlapping windows if the historical observation period were long enough. Some respondents argued that any bias at the beginning or end of the historical observation period would be negligible

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:138]
PARAGRAPH_96882: The number of respondents expressing their agreement with the proposal in the CP on the GL exceeds the number of respondents who would favour either overlapping or non-overlapping windows. Furthermore, it would depend on the composition and characteristics of the portfolio whether any of these approaches might result in bias. Finally, it can be shown that bias due to the implicit overweighting of overlapping periods can be significant even if the historical observation period is more than five years. In addition, with respect to potential bias due to the choice of reporting dates in the case of non- overlapping windows, several examples illustrate that the bias stemming from this choice can be significant, even in the case of long-term loans. An example would be agricultural loans, where defaults occur more often after the summer harvest, after it has become apparent that the revenue from crops will be insufficient.

Furthermore, the possibility of default on a short-term contract is not limited to the original maturity of the contract, given that default may be recognised only after 90 days past due.

PARAGRAPH_96904: short-term contracts introduce bias in the observed average DRs compared with portfolios in which there are no short-term contracts. The CP on the GL (like the final GL) specifies that a specific treatment should be applied only if the presence of these short-term contracts causes bias. This may, for instance, occur if loans are regularly granted in March, whereas a large share of these loans usually defaults before December, and the institution, for instance, calculates one-year DRs using non- overlapping windows coinciding with calendar years. The GL specify that institutions should analyse, inter alia, if there is bias due to the share of short-term and terminated contracts that cannot be observed during the relevant one-year periods. The GL also specify that, if such bias is found to exist, institutions should apply appropriate adjustments and MoC. Even though most respondents argue that they do not apply a specific treatment where these short- term contracts are present, the above requirement is necessary to ensure that the observed average DR is comparable across institutions and portfolios. Regarding the request for greater clarity on which adjustments would be allowed to correct the bias due to short-term contracts, it is deemed that institutions should choose the most appropriate method themselves, and therefore the GL avoid including specific approaches, since not every approach may be suitable for all types of bias introduced by short-term contracts.

PARAGRAPH_96916: With respect to the criticism that the method of calculating the observed average DR is not appropriate for low-default portfolios, it should be noted that the GL require the observed average DR to be calculated in the way specified in the GL in order to achieve a metric that is comparable across institutions, portfolios and calibration segments, as well as grades or pools. Nevertheless, the EBA acknowledges that in the case of low-default portfolios, the equally weighted average of one-year default rates may not be an accurate reflection of the likely range of variability, and therefore the GL allow, under specific conditions, specific adjustments to be made to obtain the long-run average DR on the basis of the observed average DR. These adjustments should ensure that the long-run average DR reflects the likely range of variability of DRs.

PARAGRAPH_96926: Several respondents mentioned that it was not clear how the historical observation period and long-run average DR should be determined. They questioned whether the text implies that the historical observation period should cover a whole economic cycle. Others questioned whether institutions can extend their time series of internal one-year default rates using external default rate series for which a high correlation can be found, or whether the internal time series of one-year default rates can be extended by estimating DRs based on macroeconomic indicators. Some respondents complained about the lack of a detailed specification and quantification regarding the use of the indicators to assess the historical observation period. Several respondents considered that the specifications with regard to determining the long- run average default rate were sufficiently clear.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:142] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_96927: Given the heterogeneity of business cycles across EU Member States, as well as the differences in one- year default rates across exposure types and portfolios across institutions, it is impossible to establish hard and quantitative criteria that would lead to an appropriate assessment of the historical observation period across all institutions. Therefore, the proposed approach must, naturally, incorporate qualitative aspects, which the GL already tried to achieve in the guidance on assessing whether the historical observation period is representative of the likely range of variability of the default rates of a given type of exposures. Related to this, the term 'economic cycle' has been avoided in the text of the GL, given the difficulty of providing an accurate specification of this term. In response to the other comments on this section, it has been clarified that the average of the observed one-year default rates may be adjusted if there is an overrepresentation of downturn years. Although the GL do not specify how this adjustment may be done, an extension by means of external default rates and/or based on macroeconomic indicators may be allowed, if the conditions mentioned in the GL are met.

The CP on the GL stated clearly that the long-run average default rate should be calculated as the observed average of the one-year default rates in that period if the historical observation period is representative of the likely range of variability, and this paragraph has been maintained in the final GL. The text of the GL has been clarified, and now differentiates between (a) situations where no or insufficient bad years are included in the historical observation period, and (b) situations where bad years are overrepresented in the historical observation period. With regard to the latter situation, additional conditions are included in the GL, and it is clearly stated that it should be ensured that the adjusted long-run average default rate reflects the likely range of variability of default rates. The benchmark has been maintained in the final GL, but its wording has been amended, to clarify that a situation where the adjusted long-run average DR is below the average of observed DRs should be exceptional.

Some of them suggested that a definition of 'downturn period' would be useful, or suggested further clarifying what constitutes an appropriate mix of good and bad years.

PARAGRAPH_96949: clarity regarding the assessment of the historical observation period, by referring to 'an appropriate mix of good and bad years'. Unfortunately, it was not possible to define these terms in more detail, due to the heterogeneity of business cycles across EU Member States, as well as the differences in one- year default rates across exposure types and portfolios across institutions. Therefore, naturally enough, some judgement will need to be exercised in institutions' assessments of the historical observation period. Regarding possible adjustments, it has been clarified that, whereas upward adjustments should be made whenever there are no or insufficient bad years in the historical observation period, downward adjustments in the opposite situation may be made only under specific conditions. While the GL do not specify what is an appropriate mix of good and bad years, they do include guidance on how institutions should assess whether the historical observation period is representative of the likely range of variability, by referring to (a) the variability of one-year default rates, (b) the existence, lack or prevalence of one-year default rates relating to bad years, and (c) significant changes in the economic, legal or business environment within the historical observation period.

PARAGRAPH_96961: misalignment between the concept of the long-run average DR and the five-year benchmark. Some argued that the CRR requirement of five years is a minimum requirement, and that the establishment of the benchmark transforms this into the 'norm', whereas longer time series should be used if they are available. Some respondents requested clarification on the rationale for including the benchmark. Some respondents pointed to difficulties that might arise if structural or non- structural breaks are observed during the historical observation period. Some argued that the mere availability of one-year default rates from downturn periods would determine the level of the long-run average DR. Some respondents complained about the multitude of DRs that would need to be calculated. Some argued that it would be inappropriate to set the calibration target at the average DR of the latest five years.

PARAGRAPH_96962: 'norm' in the GL, whereas this is only a minimum requirement in the CRR, it should be mentioned that this benchmark should be applied only where the adjusted long-run average default rate is below the average of the observed average DR. In this situation, it is necessary to include a backstop in the GL, since allowing downward adjustments could potentially open the door to inappropriate, imprudent long-run average DRs. The average of the most recent five-year default rates is included in the benchmark in order to ensure that increased DRs in recent periods are not seen as an exceptional situation that will not repeat itself, and the average of the available one-year default rates is included because the prior expectation is that available one- year default rates are representative of the likely range of variability. As regards concerns about the multitude of DRs that institutions will need to calculate, it should be noted that the DRs that constitute the benchmark are to be calculated only when the institution makes a downward adjustment to the average of observed one-year default rates.

One respondent stated that macroeconomic indicators do not differentiate between obligors but only between different points in time. Another respondent noted that macroeconomic variables may impact the model's calibration level but not its design. One respondent stated that their risk drivers were largely PiT rather than TTC. Stale information such as financial data updated once a year is considered to be a TTC risk driver, whereas behavioural data are considered to be a PIT risk driver. One respondent noted that financial ratios are included in the model as such without adjustments, which means that they are PIT. It was mentioned that some non-financial information is used for large corporates, which is rather TTC.

PARAGRAPH_96980: The EBA discussed the possibility of providing further guidance on the definitions of risk drivers to be included in the models, with a view to limiting unjustified variability due to the cyclicality of capital requirements stemming from PIT or TTC definitions of risk drivers. It appears to be particularly difficult to limit these definitions without unduly limiting institutions' choices with regard to how they build proper risk sensitivity into the model. The requirement already included in the CP (in paragraph 67), whereby institutions should ensure that risk drivers and rating criteria are used consistently, in particular with regard to the time horizon considered, in model development, calibration and application, has been maintained but not extended further in the final GL. Furthermore, it is required that institutions analyse the appropriateness of the philosophy underlying the assignment of obligors or exposures to grades or pools ('rating philosophy'), by taking into account, inter alia, the design of risk drivers.

Some stated that it depended on how statistically significant the differences between the various grades are, the granularity of the portfolios, the design of internal processes or the risk management practices that are in place. Some respondents stated that they designed the number of grades in order to maintain robustness in terms of sample size and risk ranking, taking into account changes in the economic environment. One industry association stated that the numbers of grades of its members varied between 12 and 34. It pointed out that the use of a master scale is quite common for non-retail exposures.

Hence the GL aim rather to enhance understanding and awareness of the impact of the option chosen on the rating philosophy, for instance by requiring that institutions should understand the characteristics and dynamics of the assignment of obligors or exposures to grades or pools ('rating assignment') and of the risk parameter estimates that result from the method used.

In the background and rationale section, the different possible approaches to the rating and calibration philosophies are explained. Furthermore, the GL require an assessment of the potential effect of portfolio versus grade calibration on the behaviour of PD estimates. As regards the selection of data for the calibration sample, the GL require institutions to find an appropriate balance between the comparability of the calibration sample to the application portfolio in terms of obligors and transaction characteristics and its representativeness of the likely range of variability of default rates.

PARAGRAPH_97056: Some respondents pointed out the different effects that portfolio calibration versus grade calibration have on the cyclicality of capital requirements. They noted that some of their members used portfolio calibration, which ensures that the PD estimates correspond to the long-run average at portfolio level, thereby leading to very stable capital requirements. However, some institutions perform calibration at grade level, i.e. they ensure that the PD estimates for each grade correspond to the long-run average for each grade. This usually entails a PiT rating system with many migrations over time, where the PD assigned to a rating is usually stable over time; however, the PD at portfolio level and the capital requirements will fluctuate with changing economic conditions. One institution pointed out that the difference between these two approaches could result in PD levels under one approach that would be twice as high as those under the other.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:151] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_97057: The EBA has discussed this comment in depth, including with regard to the effects on the cyclicality of capital requirements, and has reached the conclusion that both portfolio and grade (or pool) calibration should be allowed. However, whenever institutions apply portfolio calibration, they should perform additional calibration tests at the grade or pool level, and whenever they perform grade or pool calibration, they should perform additional calibration tests at the portfolio level (or, more specifically, at the level of the relevant calibration segment). Furthermore, institutions are required to assess the potential effect of the chosen calibration method on the behaviour of PD estimates over time.

The EBA acknowledges the difficulty of meeting both requirements at the same time, and which requirement should be retained in the GL was discussed. In this regard, it was considered that meeting one or the other requirement determines, inter alia, the cyclicality of capital requirements. It was therefore concluded that institutions should strike an appropriate balance between both requirements, with the aim of eliminating the most extreme approaches in terms of RWA cyclicality.

PARAGRAPH_97071: Some respondents stated that they do not use different rating philosophies. Some mentioned that this was because their exposures were quite homogeneous (e.g. only mortgage loans, or only consumer credit). One industry association stated that 46% of its banks use a TTC PD for mortgages and 37% use a hybrid PD. For corporate exposures, 54% reported using a TTC PD, whereas 40% reported using a hybrid PD. Some respondents stated that their rating philosophies tend to be PiT or hybrid for retail exposures, for which they rely more on behavioural information, including current accounts and days past due, than they do for non- retail exposures, for which TTC philosophies are usually used.

PARAGRAPH_97085: One industry association agreed that limiting the number or grades or pools could reduce RWA variability but opined that this topic should first be investigated further. It thought that imposing a common master scale might be one way to foster transparency and comparability. Several respondents disagreed that limiting the number of grades or pools or applying benchmarks would reduce unjustified RWA variability because such variability is indicative of a firm's ability to differentiate risk, as well as the bank's structure of exposure classes, collateral types, industries and products. These respondents would prefer a principle-based approach. Some argued that such benchmarks would penalise low-risk banks.

In addition, several respondents requested that the EBA clarify the expectation of consistency between PD and LGD databases, as disallowing the exclusion of non- representative data in the LGD development would create a misalignment with the requirements set out for PD estimates. Some respondents suggested that the historical observation period could be adjusted in line with the PD models without the need to apply an MoC. Several respondents suggested analysing the interaction between the notion of time-series LGD being 'as broad as possible' and the GL (e.g. 'all available internal data should be taken into account') in light of: representativeness considerations, anomalies, missing values, outliers, MoC requirements and the entire framework for consistency (e.g. the inclusion/exclusion of years

It has been clarified that for the purpose of risk differentiation it is possible to exclude data that is considered not representative or for the quality of which is not sufficient. The development sample should be suitable for achieving the good performance of the model. However, when calculating long-run average LGD, and in the case of PD estimation long-run average default rate, all data has to be used.

The calculation of the long-run average LGD should be based on all historical observations within the scope of application of the model. A massive disposal of NPLs, where the performing exposures of the same type remain on the balance sheet of the institution, would not change the scope of application of the model. This situation should be addressed by appropriate choices of model design and calibration methodology, for instance by the use of recovery scenarios and their probabilities.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:157]
PARAGRAPH_97147: A few respondents indicated that the representativeness assessment would be costly (e.g. in the case of data limitations to be mitigated by an industry-wide long-run data series including LGD expectations). One suggestion was to revise the term 'recovery policies', as these might entail high IT costs.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:157]
PARAGRAPH_97148: The term 'recovery policies' is used consistently throughout the GL to refer to the processes leading to recovering credit obligations from obligors, which might include soft reminders or restructuring as well as hard collection processes. This should not be confused with IT recovery policies, which are not in the scope of these GL. The representativeness of data has to be verified not only to fulfil the requirements specified in the CRR but more particularly to ensure the good performance of the model and the correct quantification of risk parameters.

PARAGRAPH_97150: A few respondents requested that the EBA clarify if adjustments leading to decreased LGD parameters based on paragraph 100(e) can be justified in the event of improvements in economic and market conditions and/or when specific actions or decisions are taken (e.g. in the case of a prolonged downward period such that it can be reasonably estimated that a reversal is due to happen).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:161]
PARAGRAPH_97222: Most respondents agreed with using a historical base rate for the calculation of the LGD discounting factor. One of the arguments was that this would reduce the divergence between discounting effect for LGD computation and contractual interest with the related recoveries, where such divergence could cause negative LGDs. One respondent suggested using the most appropriate term structure of risk-free rates. However, a few respondents argued against using a historical rate. Some stated that it would penalise banks having long historical series (the years before the introduction of the euro were characterised by high volatility of risk-free rates). Other respondents considered the proposal inconsistent with the forward-looking perspective that has to be taken into account, as emphasised by the BCBS. It was also mentioned by some respondents that if a historical rate was used the same nominal losses would be evaluated with a different LGD only

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:161] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_97223: It is specified in the GL that the discounting rate should be based on a historical rate applicable at the date of default. It was decided not to suggest any averaging, as the calculation of realised LGD should reflect the uncertainty at the moment of default. A forward-looking discounting rate applicable at the moment of estimation was not considered appropriate, as this would result in the absence of a stable measure of loss; the loss would have to be recalculated on all observations at the time of each re-estimation. This would undermine the principle of estimating LGD based on past losses and would lead to potential variability of realised LGD in the calibration phase. Back-testing methods are outside the scope of the GL, which focus on the estimation of risk parameters. However, the discounting rate is intended not to introduce additional conservatism but, rather, to reflect the uncertainty of the cash flows related to defaulted exposures.

Finally, some respondents indicated the need to more clearly separate the requirements for calculating realised LGDs for back-testing purposes from those used as model inputs, as historical LGDs used for back-testing should not include any conservatism above the real loss.

PARAGRAPH_97235: The EBA considered various possibilities for differentiating the add-on, but each of them would be problematic in terms of definitions. As this could lead to further variability and the possibility of regulatory arbitrage, it is proposed that one fixed add-on should be used. In addition, in order to avoid unwarranted variability the add-on has been specified as a fixed value rather than a floor. With regard to the level of the add-on, the results of the IRB survey confirmed that the initial proposal with regard to calibration was in line with the average level of the discounting rate in the EU. However, in order to ensure appropriate calibration of the add-on, the proposed level will be reviewed before the final date of application of the GL. The discounting rate specified in the Guidelines on the application of the definition of default is to be used only to compare the expected cash flows

A very few respondents disagreed that there was a need for an add-on, noting that Euribor is not a risk-free rate but already incorporates a funding cost, and that no spread for missed payments by the customer is needed since this would be reflected in the LGD model itself (e.g. by including cases without recovery payments in the recovery rate).

A few respondents requested clearer rules on identifying the economic circumstances. The main concerns related to the definition and length of downturn and what is expected in terms of gauging 'range of variability'. For the sake of harmonisation, respondents proposed that national competent authorities could set a prescribed starting date for the observation period, as well as the downturn years. It was suggested that an alternative approach based on economic indicators should be considered, as the observation period would be specified in such a way that it would reflect the likely range of variability of loss rates. This would decouple the definition of the relevant historical observation period from the historical data at the disposal of an individual bank.

PARAGRAPH_97264: The EBA believes that the simpler approach based on the availability of data rather than on economic circumstances is more appropriate for the estimation of the LGD. Due to the prevalence limitations in data for the purpose of LGD estimation, it is considered that a sufficiently broad sample of data is more important than the exact specification of the historical period that reflects an economic cycle. This would be particularly challenging, as in the case of LGD not only the date of default but also the whole period of the recovery process, which may span several years, are relevant. Furthermore, institutions are in any case required to estimate LGD using parameters consistent with economic downturn conditions. The principles for the identification of the downturn period will be specified in the RTS on the nature, severity and duration of economic downturn.

PARAGRAPH_97281: Many respondents requested clarification of paragraph 138(a) to allow the estimation of future recoveries stemming from collateral for open cases on which collateral has not yet been exercised, subject to enforceability conditions. These respondents were of the opinion that collateral should always be reflected in the estimation of recoveries.

PARAGRAPH_97282: The requirements included in the GL take into account the prudential consideration that where the collateral has not been realised within the specified period it may indicate some problem with the collateral that could prevent its realisation. Furthermore, beyond the maximum length of the recovery process specified for a given type of exposures, there is not sufficient data to present reliable estimates. However, with regard to individual exposures that remain in default longer than the specified maximum period, it is possible to take the existing collateral into account in the override of the assignment of the exposure to a grade or pool for the purpose of achieving appropriate ELBE and LGD in-default.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:166] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_97301: Some respondents requested clarification of paragraph 138(c) related to the analysis of the observed recovery patterns. Concerns were expressed that institutions with a higher portion of incomplete workouts would have an LGD model based mainly on estimated projected recoveries. As the long-run average LGD would not be a fully objective measure, it might lead to more unwarranted RWA variability. The overall proposal relies on the strong assumption that closed processes are fully representative of incomplete ones, but this may not be the case. Furthermore, the GL could be strengthened in terms of the required homogeneity among LGD, LGD in-default and ELBE.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:166]
PARAGRAPH_97302: As the CRR requires that all observed defaults are taken into account, it is not possible to exclude incomplete recovery processes from the calculation of long-run average LGD. Closed recovery processes may not be fully representative of incomplete processes, and therefore basing the LGD estimation only on these would not be sufficient. In particular, closed recovery processes may include a higher share of cures and shorter (more successful) recovery processes than incomplete processes, which are more likely to include the most difficult cases. Any bias stemming from such differences should be avoided. The GL specify two measures that should be used for the purpose of LGD, LGD in-default and ELBE: " observed average LGD, which is fully objective and based only on closed recovery processes and only recoveries and costs

PARAGRAPH_97312: Maximum recovery period

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:167]
PARAGRAPH_97313: Several respondents were concerned about the maximum recovery period for the purpose of LGD estimation, as it would be used only for incomplete workout processes and not for observed LGD calculation. According to the respondents, delays in payment may be due only to, for example, resistance by debtors, and hence they suggest more flexibility to allow the inclusion, at least in some cases, of estimated recoveries after a maximum recovery period. This could, for instance, be used to reflect the legal environment in some countries or be used where there is a justifiable expectation that for some loans the recoveries will continue until the scheduled end date, or at least beyond any 'general' time for the recovery process. Furthermore, institutions would most likely define extremely long periods to avoid the risk of not considering recoveries from the realisation of collateral.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:167]
PARAGRAPH_97314: The requirement for the specification of the maximum length of the recovery process for a given type of exposures has the objective of ensuring robust and prudent LGD estimates and is consistent with the general principle specified in Article 179(1)(a) of the CRR that the fewer data an institution has, the more conservative it should be in its estimates. The robust estimation of future recoveries on incomplete cases is only possible if sufficient data exist about recoveries realised in a given time after default, and this consideration should be the basis for the specification of the maximum length of the recovery process. With such a limitation, the specified maximum period of a recovery process cannot be extremely long, as beyond a certain length there would surely be too few historically observed recoveries to form the basis for a robust estimate. On the other hand, it was also specified that institutions should define the maximum period of the recovery process for a given type of exposures from the moment of default taking into account the period of time, observed in closed recovery processes, during which the institution realises the vast majority of recoveries.

PARAGRAPH_97323: Furthermore, CAs should ensure that the concept of the maximum length of the recovery process is not misused and that the lengths specified by institutions are not excessively long for a specific type of exposures. The maximum period specific for a given type of exposures should be based on previous experience and hence it should reflect the specific legal environment. However, with regard to individual exposures that remain in default longer than the specified maximum period, any specific information such as the existence of valid collateral may be taken into account in the override of the assignment of the exposure to a grade or pool for the purpose of achieving appropriate ELBE and LGD in-default.

The following cases were mentioned as potentially requiring more flexible measures: · low-default portfolios; " outliers excluded in the process of data vetting; " disposal of NPLs in extraordinary operations; information on closed recovery processes and provisions can be extrapolated to incomplete recovery processes; " available data can be taken into account

PARAGRAPH_97326: The CRR requirement that all observed defaults have to be taken into account applies to all LGD models under the IRB Approach, and hence no data exclusions are possible in the calculation of long-run average LGD. Furthermore, in the case of low-default portfolios the minimum requirements have to be met in order to receive permission to use the IRB Approach, and the CRR does not envisage any exemptions from these requirements for such portfolios. In the case of disposal of NPLs, the treatment of incomplete recovery processes is not relevant any more.

Some respondents indicated that LGD approaches should not unnecessarily separate the treatment of collateralised and unsecured exposures, as the recovery process is often managed at borrower level. In these cases, distinguishing between collateral recovery cash flows and other recovery cash flows will lead to artificial complications and will bring no added value to risk modelling. In addition, it was mentioned that a distinction between LGD ratios for the secured and unsecured parts of loan exposures would not be appropriate for asset-based finance.

It was noted that some of the requirements in this paragraph were relevant only for specific LGD estimation methodologies. For this reason, it was suggested that the provisions in this paragraph should include a 'where appropriate' statement in order to be more generally applicable.

PARAGRAPH_97389: A few respondents requested additional clarifications regarding the eligibility of collateral and specifically advocated recognition of exposures secured by durable goods (e.g. equipment leases and motor finance) as physical collateral for credit risk mitigation purposes, because the assets on which the lending is secured exist in liquid markets with transparent and publicly available pricing and can be realised quickly. One respondent suggested that legal enforceability should be recognised as a sufficient condition for the recognition of collateral and that the LGD models should reflect the range of recovery practices. Another respondent inquired about the possibility of using automated valuation models or indexed revaluation for the purpose of eligibility in accordance with Article 181(1)(f) of the

It was mentioned that banks would not always have to repossess collateral.

PARAGRAPH_97422: Purpose of collateral

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:174]
PARAGRAPH_97423: According to some respondents, the GL assume that the only purpose of collateral is repossession and liquidation, without recognising that the purpose of obtaining collateral from corporate customers is to improve the bank's ranking in the creditor hierarchy, resulting in lower loss rates during a restructuring process. The objective of this approach is to allow the firm to remain a going concern so that it can repay its debts. In some cases, liquidation of collateral (usually company assets) would be counterproductive and possibly increase losses.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:174]
PARAGRAPH_97424: The GL explicitly specify various forms in which collateral can be realised. Repossession and liquidation are not the only possible forms mentioned; the list provided is non-exhaustive, recognising that, depending on the type of collateral, other means of realising it may also be possible under a given legal framework. Furthermore, it is required that the LGD estimation methodology is consistent with the collection and recovery policies of the institution. If an institution does not in general realise collateral but rather uses it to strengthen its position against other creditors or to motivate the obligor to repay the obligations, and the institution observes higher recoveries on secured exposures, it could be recognised as a risk driver in the LGD model.

PARAGRAPH_97437: potential increase in collateral value should be allowed. In fact, it seems impossible to isolate the effect of the increase in market value until the moment of recovery. It was proposed that the estimated recovery should not exceed the collateral value, in order to prevent an overly optimistic estimated recovery. Some respondents asked for clarification regarding the meaning of 'conservative collateral valuations' (valued after the customer's default). It was considered unclear if this also included (conservative) updates of the collateral values due to changes in real estate market conditions, or the state and age of the collateral.

PARAGRAPH_97440: Several respondents did not agree with the proposal to consider the valuation of the collateral before the entry into default, as this should reflect the loss figure at the moment of default and it could also be covered by the downturn adjustment. Specialised lending should also be kept in mind here. In their view, however, it should be clarified how updated collateral valuations may be taken into account for the purposes of LGD estimation, especially if these updates of collateral valuations capture only real estate market conditions. One proposal is that consistent collateral and LGD values could be used in estimation and application.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:175]
PARAGRAPH_97441: The objective of the proposed policy was to ensure consistency between the estimation and the application of LGD. As LGD estimates are applied to non-defaulted exposures and current collateral values are used in the application of LGD, collateral values should be used also in the process of LGD estimation as applicable before defaulted status. If the valuation of collateral decreases after default, the recovery rate related to this lower value will be high. If this higher recover rate is later applied to a higher value of collateral, this will result in underestimation of LGD. It has been clarified in the GL that collateral and its value should be treated like any other risk driver in LGD estimation.

This follows the assumption that LGD parameters reflects the estimated level of loss an institution would face if the exposure defaulted within a year from the moment of estimation. In the case of defaulted exposures, for the purpose of estimating ELBE and LGD in-default, the valuation should be chosen that is appropriate for the relevant reference date. In any case, in the application of LGD, LGD in-default and ELBE, the most up-to-date value of collateral should be used.

Two respondents argued that unless the repossession is aimed at own institution use or benefit, for instance through renting, the moment of the asset sale should be relevant, rather than that of repossession. This would make the collateral valuation less subjective, since the repossession value has to be estimated while the sale price is an objective value.

PARAGRAPH_97481: Some respondents made specific comments related to the repossession of collateral in the case of leasing. In leasing contracts, the 'leased asset' is recorded in the lessor's balance sheet from the start. The respondents pointed out that the moment at which the leased asset is returned to the bank by the lessee cannot be considered in the same way as in a typical repossession, which requires the inscription of the asset in the bank's balance sheet. Furthermore, in LGD models built on leasing financial activities, the resale of the leased asset is normally the main source of recovery from the defaulted exposures. Therefore, it is important to properly consider it as part of the recovery process.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:178]
PARAGRAPH_97482: Regardless of the terminology used internally by institutions for the purpose of the application of these GL, the term 'repossession' should be understood as defined in the GL. The situation where an asset has been recorded on the institution's balance sheet since the beginning of the leasing contract does not meet the definition of repossession specified in the GL, and hence any further requirements in that regard, especially requirements in relation to haircuts, do not apply to this situation. In this case, the collateral is realised by the sale of an asset owned by an institution, and that is how it should be recognised in the LGD model. This additional clarification has been added to the GL.

PARAGRAPH_97485: Some respondents asked for clarification of the concept of repossession. A few respondents noted that the value of the repossessed collateral is adjusted by haircuts to reflect the potential price that could be achieved from a sale, so the uncertainty would be double-counted: first, in the LGD model of the institution and, second, on the books of the institution that repossesses the collateral, in the form of an investment risk.

PARAGRAPH_97486: LGD parameters reflect only estimates of potential future losses in the event that an exposure defaults, and hence they should also reflect the uncertainty of the potential recovery process.

In some cases, collateral is repossessed by institutions in the expectation that the value of the asset will increase in the future. Under these circumstances, the approach based on total cash flows would be less conservative. The objective of the GL is to ensure comparability of LGD estimates. Under the alternative approach, the LGD estimates would use a different concept of economic loss and would include an aspect of investment risk after repossession. Regardless of whether it would be more conservative or not, such LGD estimates would not be comparable with LGD estimates based on the requirements included in the GL and therefore should not be allowed.

PARAGRAPH_97530: Several respondents asked the EBA to clarify how the treatment of multi-default exposures should be combined with the probation period that the RTS on the definition of default specify and with the PD treatment in the GL (i.e. one default for LGD and two defaults for PD). It was also considered unclear what the treatment should be in the event that an exposure returns to performing status but a 12-month period after the reclassification is not observable.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:181]
PARAGRAPH_97531: The probation period specified in the Guidelines on the application of the definition of default relates to defaulted status. Exposures have to remain in defaulted status at least until the end of the probation period. This probation period aims to limit the frequency of changes in status; institutions should reclassify exposures from defaulted to non- defaulted status only when they have observed, during a probation period, a consistent improvement in the financial situation of an obligor, and hence subsequent classification back to defaulted status is less likely. However, where the situation of multiple defaults on a given exposure nevertheless occurs and the time during which the exposure was considered not defaulted is less than the specified dependence period, it is considered that the default events are related and, for the purpose of LGD estimation, the exposure should be treated as constantly defaulted. Exposures that returned to non-defaulted status should be treated as closed recovery processes also within the period directly after the return to non- defaulted status. Only where a subsequent default is observed does the treatment change to that of an

It was suggested that the treatment should be specified in the general part of the GL. Finally, a few respondents stated that the proposed threshold of one year was too conservative. They argued that internal data should be used in order to set a more reasonable threshold after the probation period, as in the Guidelines on the definition of default.

PARAGRAPH_97541: open recovery process. The treatment of multiple defaults as a continuous defaulted status for the purpose of LGD estimation does not imply a change in the required historical data. Information about all default events still has to be stored by institutions. Consistency with PD estimation should be ensured by the use of the same database of default events. Finally, after further consideration and taking into account the feedback received, the minimum length of the dependence period has been shortened from one year to nine months.

Lease payments are based on the valuation curve of the underlying asset and are systematically designed to result in a potential gain on defaults towards the end of the contract.

PARAGRAPH_97560: Consistency between defaulted and non-defaulted exposures

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:183]
PARAGRAPH_97561: Many respondents were in favour of consistency between direct estimation of LGD in-default and the methodology set for LGD for non-defaulted exposures in order to avoid potential cliff effects. Some respondents disagreed with the consistency requirements, arguing that different methodologies could be applied, e.g. unexpected loss could be directly estimated and added to ELBE. Other respondents disagreed with the consistency requirements based on the consideration of specialised credit institutions (granting instruments such as consumer credit, leasing, guarantees, etc.), as they do not manage current bank accounts and do not have access to precise customer behaviour information. Models for LGD for non-defaulted exposures would be less precise than models for LGD in-default, and this could lead to cliff effects.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:183]
PARAGRAPH_97562: The GL require institutions to use consistent methodologies for the estimation of LGD for defaulted and non-defaulted exposures, as in either cases the methodology should be appropriate for the particular type of exposures as well as the internal collection and recovery policies of the institution. However, they also explicitly require that all relevant risk drivers should be used, including those that may become relevant after the date of default. This means that the models for defaulted and non-defaulted exposures will not be exactly the same, as more information is available at certain reference dates after default, which should be No change adequately reflected in the estimates of LGD in- default and ELBE. Furthermore, both the GL and the RTS on IRB assessment methodology also acknowledge that LGD in-default may be estimated either directly or by estimating an add-on over ELBE. However, regardless of which of the approaches is used, the results should be consistent such that the difference between LGD in-default and ELBE reflects the downturn adjustment, the MoC and other unexpected losses.

PARAGRAPH_97570: Provisions as ELBE

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:184]
PARAGRAPH_97571: Many respondents advocated consistency between ELBE and accounting provisions, rather than consistency between the estimates for defaulted and non-defaulted exposures. They were of the opinion that it should be permissible to use provisioning models for the purpose of ELBE estimation. They argued that it would be too burdensome to develop two sets of models for accounting and for prudential purposes, taking into account that the proportion of defaulted assets is usually small. Some respondents suggested that some kind of materiality threshold could be introduced for requiring an own ELBE model in addition to the provisioning model. Furthermore, it was mentioned that a treatment of ELBE consistent with the provisions on NPL has to be achieved, because the IRB excess/shortfall depends on this comparison. Some respondents stated that the CRR is independent of provisioning, while others suggested that the range of circumstances under which firms are able to use provisioning models should be broadened.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:184]
PARAGRAPH_97572: The EBA does not consider the use of accounting provisions appropriate. It was considered both legally and operationally problematic to specify what constitutes immaterial defaulted portfolios and define simplified rules for these portfolios. The estimation of parameters for defaulted exposures is required only of those institutions that use LGD models for non-defaulted exposures. Since ELBE and LGD in-default are expected to be based on similar methodologies, it should not be too burdensome for institutions to develop such models, especially given that the A-IRB Approach is mostly applied by large institutions. Furthermore, from a legal perspective the introduction of simplified rules was considered to be problematic. The CRR already provides certain alternative solutions for situations where LGD cannot be modelled, such as F-IRB for non-retail exposures or estimation based on total losses for retail exposures and purchased receivables. For all other situations, the CRR specifies that permission to use internal models can be granted only if all minimum requirements are met. It is therefore not possible to specify in the GL provisions contradicting this requirement.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:185]
PARAGRAPH_97584: Several respondents would welcome additional details regarding the three components of the add- on over ELBE, in particular the additional unexpected loss. The respondents argued that the variability of recovery rates due to negative macroeconomic conditions was already addressed by the downturn component and that the remaining volatility typically underlay the estimate of the MoC. They argued that it should therefore be clarified in the GL that the unexpected loss component was intended as something exceptional, and that it could be equal to zero.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:185]
PARAGRAPH_97585: Where all identified uncertainty and potential unexpected losses are sufficiently covered by the downturn adjustment and MoC, the component of the add-on reflecting potential additional losses may be zero. However, these additional potential sources of unexpected losses have in any case to be analysed by the institution and reflected adequately where necessary. In particular, this additional component of the add-on may be applied to the whole portfolio, to a subset of exposures (e.g. selected pools) or to individual exposures.

PARAGRAPH_97589: Most of the respondents agreed with the proposed definition of the reference date.

As LGD in-default and ELBE are in fact part of the LGD model, all the requirements for such models specified in the CRR have to be met.

The inclusion of open recovery processes brings valuable information, including information on the most difficult cases with longer recovery periods, as well as the most recent trends. Therefore, omitting these observations would lead to less robust estimates. However, institutions should also make sure that estimates of future recoveries on incomplete recovery processes are well justified and prudent in order to avoid any distortions in the final estimates of risk parameters due to the use of uncertain information.

The respondents advocated a comprehensive approach linking IFRS 9 PIT calibration, stress testing, ELBE PIT calibration and downturn LGD estimates.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:189]
PARAGRAPH_97657: Several respondents argued against the requirements to reflect downturn conditions in LGD in-default/ELBE. It was argued that this would overstate the total potential losses of the bank, as the suggested approach would not reflect portfolio and diversification effects. Not all transactions are sensitive to macroeconomic parameters, not all defaults occur in downturn periods and, finally, any downturn effect should be considered over the life of the exposures, i.e. considering cycles that may include possible periods of economic recovery. Therefore, clarification was requested regarding how the downturn notion should be applied.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:189]
PARAGRAPH_97658: The GL do not require that downturn conditions be reflected in ELBE estimates, as these should rather reflect current economic conditions, as required by Article 181(1)(h) of the CRR. LGD in-default should be estimated under the same requirements as those for LGD for non-defaulted exposures specified in Article 181 of the CRR. Therefore, in the absence of a specific exemption as in the case of ELBE, the requirement of Article 181(1)(b) that the estimates should reflect economic downturn if this is more conservative than the long-run average also applies.

PARAGRAPH_97667: Some respondents considered that the inclusion of a downturn conditions component amounted to gold-plating of the rules prescribed in the CRR, as Article 181(1)(h) only refers to additional unexpected losses during the recovery period. In addition, it was not clear to respondents why the downturn component was linked to ELBE estimation if this component was to be added only for the LGD in-default.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:191]
PARAGRAPH_97687: Some respondents requested additional clarifications and guidance on how to apply the concept and on the implementation deficiencies that would lead to additional conservatism in the application of risk parameters. In addition, confirmation was requested that, as the triggers are remediated, the conservatism should be removed without a further supervisory assessment (i.e. without material model change).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:191]
PARAGRAPH_97688: It was clarified in the GL that implementation deficiencies should be understood as deficiencies related to the implementation of the model in the IT system, where relevant. This may be the case where the IT system does not reflect the model in an exact manner and hence may indicate different rating assignments of risk estimates from those assumed by the model. Conservatism in the application should not be considered part of the model; therefore, the removal of the conservatism once the trigger has been remediated should not be considered a change in the model. However, any changes in the institution's policy on how and when this additional conservatism should be applied can be considered a change to the rating system and should be notified to the competent authority in accordance with the Regulation (EU) No 529/2014.

PARAGRAPH_97702: Additional conservatism in the application of risk parameters is related to the current information and rating processes, where the deficiencies may lead to an inappropriate application of the model.

PARAGRAPH_97787: Several institutions argued for a transitional or phase-in period. It was argued that a phase-in approach for models that have to be reworked would be appropriate. Others argued that grandfathering for existing models with regard to the MoC concept should be considered, or that general 'transitional' grandfathering should be considered. It was also suggested that flexibility and proportionality should be introduced for the transitional phase. Finally, it was suggested that the implementation should be managed more efficiently, e.g. by preapproving foreseeable steps. One institution assumed that there would not be a relevant impact on RWA and regulatory capital, since current models are in line with the CRR. If this was not the case, it was stated, it would be bad for the reputation of both supervisors and banks, and would lead to reduced trust in internal models.

PARAGRAPH_97804: was too burdensome, and would be the main reason for reworking the models. One respondent expected a capital impact due to increased conservatism in the models. One respondent opined that the main changes would stem from the expected downturn guidance.

PARAGRAPH_97805: framework have been taken into account in the revision of the MoC categories. In particular, fewer and clearer categories should facilitate classification and quantification, and reduce the burden on institutions. As regards the impact due to the downturn guidance, the EBA has discussed both regulatory products in parallel, and is envisaging an amendment to the final GL at the point of finalisation of the RTS on the nature, severity and duration of economic downturn. A separate report has been developed in order to take into account industry practices on the main policy areas in the GL, as well as to assess the costs and benefits of these policies. The impact assessment of the RTS on the nature, severity and duration of economic downturn will be included in those RTS.

PARAGRAPH_97806: One respondent recommended carefully assessing the overall impact of the draft GL to avoid unintended increases in capital requirements.

PARAGRAPH_97807: The EBA acknowledges the importance of assessing the impact of its regulatory products. For the purpose of these GL, a precise quantification of the impact of the GL would require that institutions carry out a full redevelopment and recalibration of their PD and LGD models to ensure consistency with the GL. Given that such an exercise would be overly burdensome, the EBA has approached this issue differently, i.e. by asking specific, qualitative, questions on modelling practices. Based on these responses, the EBA obtained a view on the distribution of industry practices. For most policy choices, the policy chosen in the GL represents the most common approach observed. On an aggregate basis, we expect the impact of the proposal to be

PARAGRAPH_97816: neutral for the models surveyed, as the specifications in the GL take into account current practices for those models. Furthermore, it would be impossible to predict the impact on capital requirements on the basis of the responses to the IRB survey, because internal models feature many possible modelling choices. As a result, the final impact of these GL will be known only after the redevelopment and recalibration of the models. This aspect supports the need to monitor the impact of the implementation of these GL.

PARAGRAPH_97818: A preliminary cost-benefit analysis has been included in the CP on the GL. However, the EBA conducted a survey on IRB modelling practices between mid- December 2016 and the end of January 2017. On the basis of the input received to that survey, a detailed report has been developed, which includes a cost- benefit analysis for several other policy areas, and which is published together with these GL.

PARAGRAPH_97821: A majority of respondents stated that the majority of models would need to be reworked. Some respondents stated that all their models would have to be reworked materially. One respondent stated that at least one quarter of all its models would require a material model change. Some respondents expected a significant implementation burden, in relation to not only the models but also the processes that would have to be adjusted. One respondent acknowledged that it expected a material impact on its models but also welcomed

PARAGRAPH_97822: The EBA carried out an assessment of the number of models that would need to be changed. In particular, the responses to the IRB survey were used to assess the proportion of models (and exposures) that would need to be changed for each policy aspect. The report on IRB modelling practices contains a summary of the proportion of models (and exposures) for which at least one, two, three, etc., aspects would need to be changed. From this analysis, it appears most likely that all models will need to be changed, at least in one aspect. However,

PARAGRAPH_97834: A majority of respondents pointed out that the main sources of changes would be the estimation of LGD, LGD in-default and ELBE. Some respondents argued that the operational cost of enhancements to documentation, justifications and changes to processes would be significant. One respondent argued that the costs of complying with these GL would be very heavy, especially in respect of IT systems.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:200]
PARAGRAPH_97835: The EBA acknowledges that the implementation of the GL in particular, and the IRB review package in a broader sense, entails an operational burden on institutions, owing to the redevelopment and recalibration of models, changes in processes and changes to IT systems in general. However, a cost- benefit analysis has been conducted (see the impact assessment of the GL), in which the benefits resulting from, inter alia, reduced unjustified RWA variability, have been taken into account.
