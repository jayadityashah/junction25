PARAGRAPH_36912: (4) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, ensuring the effective policies, procedures and internal control referred to in chapter 3, section 16 of the AML Act requires that the supervised entity has first prepared a risk assessment, in which it identifies and assesses the risks of non-compliance with sanctions regulation and national freezing orders it is exposed to, as well as their probabilities.

PARAGRAPH_36913: (5) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, the effective policies, procedures and internal control referred to in chapter 3, section 16 of the AML Act shall be commensurate with the risks identified in the risk assessment. The supervised entity may apply a risk-based approach in determining how to allocate resources to ensuring compliance with sanctions regulation and national freezing orders. However, in doing so it must be ensured that the supervised entity has adequate resources in all areas of its operation to ensure that sanctions regulation and national freezing orders are complied with in all respects. Risk-based discretion may not be applied as to whether the supervised entity complies with sanctions regulation and national freezing orders in all respects.

Applying a risk-based approach, the supervised entity allocates more resources on the areas of its operation which are the most vulnerable to sanctions imposed on Russia. Among other things, the supervised entity scrutinises Russian payment traffic on an enhanced basis (including the background and purpose of payments) with respect to customers that have payments to/ from Russia.

Regardless, the supervised entity must comply with prohibitions and obligations associated with the Nicaraguan sanctions regime, but it does not have to allocate the same amount of resources to ensuring compliance with this regime as to the perceived higher-risk sanctions. At the time of assessment, the Nicaraguan sanctions regime included only sanctions on individuals and entities. Hence, the supervised entity shall ensure that the sanctions list related to the sanctions regime is incorporated in the supervised entity's sanctions monitoring without establishing separate risk management procedures for this risk.

For example, the provision of financial services may involve prohibitions or restrictions under sanctions regulation. In particular, in the context of trade finance services, it is necessary to ensure that the transactions are not violating sanctions regulation and do not seek to evade sanctions regulation.
