PARAGRAPH_80114: In accordance with the requirements introduced by Directive 2013/36/EU as amended by Directive 2019/878/EU and Directive 2014/65/EU, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Banking Authority (EBA) jointly issue Guidelines on the notions of suitability, as required by Article 91 (12) of Directive 2013/36/EU and Article 9 (1) of Directive 2014/65/EU1, and on the assessment of suitability by institutions and competent authorities.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_80115: The directives aim to remedy weaknesses that were identified during the financial crisis regarding the functioning of the management body and its members. The Guidelines aim to further improve and harmonise the assessment of suitability within the EU financial sector, and to ensure sound governance arrangements in institutions.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_80116: The Guidelines apply to all institutions, independent of their governance structures (unitary board, dual board or other structures), without advocating or preferring any specific structure as set out in the defined scope of application. The terms 'management body in its management function' and 'management body in its supervisory function' should be interpreted throughout the Guidelines in accordance with the applicable law within each Member State.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_80117: The Guidelines specify that all institutions have to assess the members of the management body. Institutions that are subject to Directive 2013/36/EU also have to assess all key function holders that have a significant influence over the direction of the institution under the overall responsibility of the management body. Competent authorities are required to assess all members of the management body. For significant CRD institutions, competent authorities should assess the heads of internal control functions and the chief financial officer (CFO), where they are not members of the management body. This should be done at the highest level of consolidation for significant CRD institutions that are part of a group but not subject to prudential consolidation by a significant consolidating CRD institution, and at the individual level if the significant CRD institution is not part of a group.

PARAGRAPH_80128: It is important to improve the diversity of management bodies to overcome the risk of groupthink; to this end, the Guidelines determine how diversity is to be taken into account in the process for selecting members of the management body. In particular, institutions should take measures to ensure that gender balance is taken into account when selecting members of the management body.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_80137: 1. Weaknesses in corporate governance, including inadequate oversight by and challenge from the supervisory function of the management body in a number of credit institutions and investment firms, have contributed to excessive and imprudent risk-taking in the financial sector which has led in turn to the failure of individual institutions and systemic problems.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_80138: 2. Against this background, it has become obvious that the role and responsibilities of management bodies in both their supervisory and management functions should be strengthened in order to ensure sound and prudent management of credit institutions and investment firms, to protect the integrity of the market and the interest of consumers.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_80139: 3. Directive 2013/36/EU as amended by Directive 2019/878/EU and Directive 2014/65/EU include requirements to remedy weaknesses that were identified during the financial crisis regarding the functioning and composition of the management body and the qualification of its members.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_80140: 4. The Guidelines are intended to apply to all existing board structures and do not advocate any particular structure. The Guidelines do not interfere with the general allocation of competences in accordance with national company law. Accordingly, they should be applied irrespective of the board structures used (unitary and/or dual board structure and/or other structures) across Member States. The management body, as defined in points (7) and (8) of Article 3(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU, should be understood as having management (executive) and supervisory (non-executive) functions.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_80141: 5. The terms 'management body in its management function' and 'management body in its supervisory function' are used throughout these Guidelines without referring to any specific governance structure and references to the management (executive) or supervisory (non- executive) function should be understood as applying to the bodies or members of the management body responsible for that function in accordance with national law.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_80142: 6. In Member States where the management body delegates, partially or fully, the executive function to a person or an internal executive body (e.g. chief executive officer (CEO), management team or executive committee), the persons who perform those executive functions on the basis of that delegation should be understood as constituting the management function of the management body. For the purposes of these Guidelines any reference to the management body in its management function should be understood as including also the members of the executive body or the CEO, as defined in these Guidelines, even if they have not been proposed or appointed as formal members of the institution's governing body or bodies under national law.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_80149: 7. The management body is empowered to set the institution's strategy, objectives and overall direction, and oversees and monitors management decision-making. The management body in its management function directs the institution. Senior management is accountable to the management body for the day-to-day running of the institution. The management body in its supervisory function oversees and challenges the management function and provides appropriate advice. The oversight roles include reviewing the performance of the management function and the achievement of objectives, and monitoring and ensuring the integrity of financial information as well as the soundness and effectiveness of the risk management and internal controls.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_80150: 8. Considering all existing governance structures provided for by national laws, competent authorities should ensure the effective and consistent application of the Guidelines in their jurisdiction in accordance with the rationale and objectives of the Guidelines themselves. For this purpose, competent authorities may clarify the governing bodies and functions to which the tasks and responsibilities set forth in the Guidelines pertain, when this is appropriate to ensure the proper application of the Guidelines in accordance with the governance structures provided for under the national company law.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_80151: 9. Investment firms as defined by and falling under the scope of Directive 2014/65/EU may be set up as limited companies or as other legal forms, including those cases where investment firms are natural persons or investment firms are legal persons managed by a single natural person (as described under Article 9(6) of MiFID II). In some situations, the management body may comprise a small group of individuals who will each perform both executive and supervisory functions. Where these Guidelines refer to the management body in its management and supervisory functions, and, pursuant to national law, these functions are not assigned to different bodies or different members within one body, the activities of both functions should nonetheless be performed by the management body.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_80152: 10. Branches in a Member State of institutions authorised in a third country are subject to suitability requirements equivalent to those applicable to institutions within Member States. As those branches do not have a management body independent of their head office, such branches and competent authorities should assess the individuals who effectively direct the branch. For the assessment of the suitability of the CFO, the heads of internal control functions and, where identified by branches in a risk-based approach, other key function holders, it is expected that competent authorities apply these Guidelines by analogy.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_80153: 11. These Guidelines set out the measures for the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body, including the CEO, even when he or she is not part of the institution's governing body or bodies in accordance with national law. The Guidelines also foresee the assessment of the relevant institution's key function holders (i.e. the CFO and the heads of internal control functions where they are not part of the management body and, where identified by relevant institutions in a risk-based approach, other key function holders) who have a significant influence over the direction of the business. These assessments are considered to be proportionate to ensure robust governance arrangements that ensure the

PARAGRAPH_80161: 12. Where the Guidelines refer to the CEO, CFO, heads of internal control functions and other key function holders, they do not intend to impose the appointment of such persons unless prescribed by the relevant EU or national law. If activities of an internal control function are performed by an outsourcing provider, the management body retains responsibility for the activities performed on behalf of the institution.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_80162: 13. Other than for the purposes of the legislation applicable to institutions specifically under Directive 2013/36/EU and Directive 2014/65/EU, the Guidelines do not aim to interfere with other legislation such as social, company or labour law, which needs to be complied with by institutions together with other and independently of EU legislation. Those laws in Member States appear to be divergent across the EU and limit the possible level of harmonisation in this particular area.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_80163: 14. The Guidelines take into account the European Commission's recommendation of 15 February 20052 on the role of non-executive or supervisory directors of listed companies and on the committees of the supervisory board, and the results of the EBA's review of its Guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders of credit institutions.

To further harmonise the assessment of suitability within the EU banking and securities sector in line with the requirements introduced by Directive 2013/36/EU and Directive 2014/65/EU, a mandate is given to the EBA to issue Guidelines on the notions of suitability jointly with ESMA in line with Article 91(12) of Directive 2013/36/EU and Article 9(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU. The joint adoption of these Guidelines is related to the relevant competences of the EBA and ESMA. Where requirements of the Guidelines apply to institutions that are subject to Directive 2013/36/EU, but not to institutions that are subject only to Directive 2014/65/EU, the Guidelines refer to credit institutions.

PARAGRAPH_80204: 30. As required by Article 91 of Directive 2013/36/EU and Article 9 of Directive 2014/65/EU, the Guidelines specify the notion of sufficient time commitment, the notion of adequate individual and collective knowledge, skills and experience; the notions of honesty, integrity and independence of mind with which the members of the management body should comply; the notion of adequate human and financial resources for induction and training; and the notion of diversity which is to be taken into account when recruiting members of the management body and the power of the competent authority to remove members of the management body.

PARAGRAPH_80205: 31. The Guidelines aim to establish harmonised criteria for the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders, to ensure sound assessment processes as part of the institution's governance arrangements.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:11] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_80206: 32. The Guidelines encompass the assessment of members of the management body in its management function and members of the management body in its supervisory function. The suitability of both functions is equally important for the well-functioning of an institution. As the members of the management body may have specific roles, the assessment process and criteria can differ. Members of the management body representing a Member State, a public authority of a Member State or a public entity must also be suitable at all times.

PARAGRAPH_80207: 33. All staff of institutions should be suitable for performing their job.

Their suitability is therefore of utmost importance and more detailed suitability elements and processes are necessary. This also applies to the CFO where he or she is not part of the

PARAGRAPH_80217: 34. The ongoing suitability of all members of the management body and key function holders is crucial for the proper functioning of an institution, and therefore institutions are required to assess the suitability of all these persons.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:12]
PARAGRAPH_80218: 35. Events which may potentially affect the required knowledge, skills and experience of a member of the management body or a key function holder, or that person's reputation, honesty, integrity, independence of mind or time commitment, should lead to a re- assessment by the institution of the suitability of that person and potentially a re-assessment of the collective suitability of the management body.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:12]
PARAGRAPH_80219: 36. Members of the management body should have sufficient time to carry out their respective responsibilities appropriately. Members of the management body should have sufficient time to cover all the necessary subjects in depth, and in particular the management of the main risks. For CRD institutions, this includes all material risks addressed in Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, including the valuation of assets and the use of external credit ratings and internal models relating to those risks.

PARAGRAPH_80220: 37. Members of the management body should also have sufficient time to acquire, maintain and enhance their knowledge and skills - if necessary through additional training. This is to ensure that they understand the institution's structure and development, and relevant changes in the legal and economic environment, as well as to maintain up-to-date knowledge and to deliver a high level of performance at all times.

The members of the management body and key function holders should have sufficient knowledge, skills and experience to fulfil their individual position in an institution, and the management body must collectively possess adequate knowledge, skills and experience to understand the institution's activities including the main risks. These knowledge, skills and experience should be kept up to date, taking into account changes in the nature, scale and complexity of the institution's activities. Adequate knowledge, skills and experience cannot be determined by having experience expressed only in terms of a period of time in a certain position or a specific educational degree, but need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

PARAGRAPH_80231: 42. Institutions need to provide sufficient resources for induction and training of members of the management body. Receiving induction should make new members familiar with the specificities of the institution's structure, how the institution is embedded in its group structure (where relevant), and business and risk strategy. Ongoing training should aim to improve and keep up to date the qualifications of members of the management body so that at all times the management body collectively meets or exceeds the level that is expected. Ongoing training is a necessity to ensure sufficient knowledge of changes in the relevant legal and regulatory requirements, markets and products, and the institution's structure, business model and risk profile.

PARAGRAPH_80232: 43. While the diversity of the management body is not a criterion for the assessment of the members' individual suitability, diversity should also be taken into account when selecting and assessing members of management bodies. Diversity within the management body leads to a broader range of experience, knowledge, skills and values, and is one of the factors that enhance the functioning of the management body and address the phenomenon of group- think. Thus, a more diverse management body, in its supervisory and management functions, can reduce the phenomenon of groupthink and facilitate independent opinions and constructive challenging in the process of decision-making. Diversity, together with an adequate consideration of inclusion, will help to ensure that the diverse perspectives and opinions of the members of the management body are taken into account within the management body.

This is mentioned in Directive 2013/36/EU as well as in Directive 2014/65/EU and is also expressed by other initiatives at EU level that aim to improve gender diversity6. Institutions should respect the principle of equal opportunities for any gender and take measures to ensure a more gender-balanced composition of staff in management positions in order to ensure that there is overall a more gender-balanced pool of candidates for positions within the management body.

PARAGRAPH_80244: 47. Institutions are primarily responsible for ensuring that members of the management body fulfil the suitability criteria as defined in the Guidelines on an ongoing basis, and need to establish appropriate policies and procedures for this purpose. The nomination committee required for significant CRD institutions has a key role in assessing the suitability, diversity and composition of the management body. Where no nomination committee is established, the management body in its supervisory function as part of the institution's governance arrangements is responsible for fulfilling the tasks that are normally performed by the nomination committee, to ensure the effective and prudent management of the institution and the effectiveness of the institution's governance arrangements.

Institutions should assess the suitability of proposed members and members of the management body prior to their appointment or when duly justified as soon as practicable, but in any case within one month of the appointment, and should inform the competent authority of the proposed appointment or without delay after the appointment.

PARAGRAPH_80246: 49. Competent authorities should have processes in place for the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body of all institutions and the heads of internal control functions and the CFOs of significant CRD institutions, where they are not part of the management body, as set out in the Guidelines. Competent authorities may choose to assess a broader scope of key function holders. In particular competent authorities' processes should ensure that all these persons are assessed in a timely manner.

PARAGRAPH_80247: 50. The Guidelines do not harmonise the point in time when assessments of the suitability of members of the management body should be made. While an assessment before a member takes up the position would ensure that the member is suitable from the beginning of his or her mandate, the Guidelines took into account the practicalities under such a process. A higher level of harmonisation would be desirable within the banking union, but could not be achieved in the current circumstances due, among other things, to the existing fragmented national frameworks.

It is distinct from criminal or administrative infringement procedures. Institutions have to ensure that members of the management body and key function holders are suitable for their respective roles. When concerns have been raised, it is up to the institution to demonstrate that the individual meets reputation, honesty and integrity standards. In this respect, competent authorities are also required to verify whether the suitability requirements under CRD and MiFID as further specified in these Guidelines are still fulfilled where they have reasonable grounds to suspect

PARAGRAPH_80256: 52. Preventing money laundering and terrorist financing is essential for maintaining the stability and integrity of the financial system. Involvement of an institution in money laundering and terrorist financing might have an impact on its viability and the trust in the financial system. Directive (EU) 2015/849 (AMLD), in line with international standards for the prevention of money laundering and countering terrorist financing (AML/CFT) set by the Financial Action Task Force, stresses the importance of senior management taking responsibility for the identification, assessment and management of ML/TF risks and requires, without prejudice to the national transposition of Directive 2015/849/EU, institutions to identify the member of the management board7 who is responsible for the implementation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with AMLD.

PARAGRAPH_80258: 54. Against this background, institutions and competent authorities should be aware of the negative impact on an institution's safety and soundness that could be produced in the event of a possible involvement of a member of the management body and/or a key function holder in ML/TF or of the institution being unwilling to take robust action to manage the risk of the institution's involvement in ML/TF.

PARAGRAPH_80259: 55. Together with competent authorities responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering requirements under Directive (EU) 2015/849 (AML Supervisors) and other relevant bodies (such as Financial Intelligence Units), competent authorities have an important role to play in identifying and tackling weaknesses in institutions' AML/CFT systems and controls. In this context, the Guidelines clarify in line with Directive 2013/36/EU that the knowledge, experience and skill requirements of at least the member of the management body who is responsible for the implementation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with AMLD include identifying, managing and mitigating money laundering and financing of terrorism risk. The Guidelines also clarify that the ability to understand ML/TF risks is part of the assessments of the collective suitability of the members of the management body and the assessment of key function holders.

PARAGRAPH_80269: 56. It is crucial for competent authorities when assessing the suitability of members of the management body of all institutions and heads of internal control functions and the CFO of significant CRD institutions, where they are not part of the management body, to have access to and to assess specific information about the persons.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:16]
PARAGRAPH_80270: 57. The Guidelines set out in Annex III the documentation and information to be provided for initial10 and ongoing assessments. However, competent authorities are not limited to this information; e.g. within the supervisory process, a competent authority can also gather additional information on the suitability of persons. Relevant information that can be taken into account in the assessment of suitability can also come from other sources, such as internal whistleblowing or from external sources, when this information is deemed to be reliable.

PARAGRAPH_80271: 58. It is important to ensure that institutions and competent authorities intervene if a member of the management body, a member proposed for such a position or the management body collectively is not suitable. This also applies to key function holders. Measures available to competent authorities may differ between Member States depending on the applicable national laws. Such measures can range from imposing conditions to ordering an institution to take action to improve the skills and knowledge of a member, or to transferring responsibilities between members, prohibiting a member or an institution from performing tasks, temporarily banning or replacing a member of the management body, or ultimately withdrawing the institution's authorisation. However, if a member of the management body is not suitable, competent authorities have the power to remove such a person from that position.

PARAGRAPH_80272: 59. The Guidelines also take into account the recovery and resolution framework introduced by Directive 2014/59/EU (BRRD) and provide further guidance in this regard. During resolution and also as part of early intervention measures, the suitability of newly appointed members of the management body and of the management body collectively is relevant in accordance with Articles 27, 28 and 34(1)(c) of BRRD. The Guidelines aim to ensure that such assessments are conducted in an appropriate timeframe, considering the urgency of the situation, and that there is an appropriate interaction between competent authorities and resolution authorities. In contrast, the assessment of special managers under Article 35(1) of BRRD falls exclusively within the competence of resolution authorities, which appoint a special manager under the conditions of Article 35(1) of BRRD, namely an assessment of whether the special manager has the qualifications, ability and knowledge required to carry out his or her functions. This appointment does not depend on the assessment of the competent authority.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:25]
PARAGRAPH_80420: 18. The proportionality principle aims to match governance arrangements consistently with the individual risk profile and business model of the institution and takes into account the individual position for which an assessment is made so that the objectives of the regulatory requirements are effectively achieved.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:25] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_80421: 19. Institutions should take into account their size, their internal organisation and the nature, scale and complexity of their activities when developing and implementing policies and processes set out in these Guidelines. Significant institutions should have more sophisticated policies and processes, while in particular small and less complex institutions may implement simpler policies and processes. Institutions should note that the size or systemic importance of an institution may not, by itself, be indicative of the extent to which an institution is exposed to risks. Those policies and processes should, however, ensure compliance with the criteria specified in these Guidelines to assess the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders and the elements to take diversity into account when recruiting members to the management body and to provide sufficient resources for their induction and training.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:25]
PARAGRAPH_80422: 20. All members of the management body and key function holders should, in any event, be of sufficiently good repute and have honesty and integrity, and all members of the management body should have independence of mind regardless of the institution's size, internal organisation and the nature, scope and complexity of its activities, and the duties and responsibilities of the specific position, including memberships held in committees of the management body.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:25]
PARAGRAPH_80423: 21. For the purpose of applying the principle of proportionality and in order to ensure the appropriate implementation of the governance requirements of Directive 2013/36/EU and Directive 2014/65/EU which the Guidelines further specify, the following criteria should be taken into account by institutions and competent authorities:

PARAGRAPH_80582: 52. When multiple institutions within the same group hold qualifying holdings, the directorships in all qualifying holdings should be counted, taking into account the consolidated situation (based on the accounting scope of consolidation) of the institution, as one separate single directorship. That single directorship in qualifying holdings counts as a separate single directorship, i.e. the single directorship counted for the directorships held within entities that belong to the group and the single directorship counted for the directorships held in all qualifying holdings of the same group count together as two directorships.

Where a member of the management body holds directorships in different groups or undertakings, all directorships held within the same institutional protection scheme, as referred to in Article 91(4)(b)(i) of Directive 2013/36/EU, count as a single directorship. Where the application of the rule set out in Article 91(4)(b)(i) of Directive 2013/36/EU, regarding the counting of directorships within the same institutional protection scheme, leads to a higher count of single directorships than the application of the rule set out in Article 91(4)(a) regarding the counting of single directorships within groups, the resulting lower number of single directorships should apply (e.g. where directorships are held within two groups, in both cases within undertakings that are members and at the same time within undertakings that are not members of the same institutional protection scheme, only two single directorships should be counted).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:41]
PARAGRAPH_80705: 78. When assessing the independence of members, institutions should differentiate between the notion of 'independence of mind', applicable to all members of an institution's management body, and the principle of 'being independent', required for certain members of a relevant institution's management body in its supervisory function. The criteria for the assessment of 'independence of mind' are provided in section 9.2 and for the assessment of 'being independent' in section 9.3.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:41]
PARAGRAPH_80706: 79. Acting with 'independence of mind' is a pattern of behaviour, shown in particular during discussions and decision-making within the management body, and is required for each member of the management body regardless of whether or not the member is considered as 'being independent' in accordance with section 9.3. All members of the management body should engage actively in their duties and should be able to make their own sound, objective and independent decisions and judgments when performing their functions and responsibilities.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:41]
PARAGRAPH_80707: 80. 'Being independent' means that a member of the management body in its supervisory function does not have any present or recent past relationships or links of any nature with the relevant institution or its management that could influence the member's objective and balanced judgement and reduce the member's ability to take decisions independently. The fact that a member is considered as 'being independent' does not mean that the member of the management body should automatically be deemed to be 'independent of mind' as the member might lack the required behavioural skills.

Where a member falls under one or more of the situations set out in paragraph 89, the relevant institution may demonstrate to the competent authority that the member should nevertheless be considered as 'being independent'. To this end relevant institutions should be able to justify to the competent authority the reasoning why the member's ability to exercise objective and balanced judgement and to take decisions independently is not affected by the situation.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:48] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_80823: 102. In accordance with Article 91(10) of Directive 2013/36/EU, all institutions should have and implement a policy promoting diversity on the management body, in order to promote a diverse pool of members. It should aim to engage a broad set of qualities and competences when recruiting members of the management body, to achieve a variety of views and experiences and to facilitate independent opinions and sound decision-making within the management body. Institutions should aim at an appropriate representation of all genders within the management body and ensure that the principle of equal opportunities is respected when selecting members of the management body. Having employee representatives, where required under national law, of the under-represented gender alone is not sufficient to ensure that the management body has an appropriate gender balance.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:48]
PARAGRAPH_80824: 103. The diversity policy should at least refer to the following diversity aspects: educational and professional background, gender, age and, in particular for institutions that are active internationally, geographical provenance, unless the inclusion of the aspect of geographical provenance is unlawful under the laws of the Member State. The diversity policy for significant CRD institutions should include a quantitative target for the representation of the under-represented gender in the management body. Significant CRD institutions should quantify the targeted participation of the under-represented gender and specify an appropriate timeframe within which the target should be met and how it will be met. The target should be defined for the management body collectively, but may be broken down into the management and supervisory functions where a sufficiently large management body exists. In all other institutions, in particular with a management body of fewer than five members, the target may be expressed in a qualitative way.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:48]
PARAGRAPH_80825: 104. When setting diversity objectives, institutions should consider diversity benchmarking results published by competent authorities, the EBA or other relevant international bodies or organisations28.

PARAGRAPH_80826: 105. The diversity policy may include employee representation within the management body in order to add day-to-day practical knowledge and experience of the internal workings of the institution.

The assessment of the individual and collective suitability of the members of the management body and, in case of significant CRD institutions, the assessment of the individual suitability of the heads of internal control functions and the CFO, where they are not part of the management body, should be performed on an ongoing basis by competent authorities, as part of their ongoing supervisory activity. Competent authorities should ensure that necessary re-assessments under sections 1, 2 and 3 of Title II are conducted by institutions. If a re-assessment of suitability by a competent authority is prompted by a re-assessment by an institution, that competent authority should in particular take into account the circumstances that prompted the re-assessment by the institution. In particular, competent authorities should re-assess the individual or collective suitability of the members of the management body and the individual suitability of heads of internal control functions and the CFO, where they are not part of the management body, within significant CRD institutions referred in paragraph 172 whenever significant new facts or evidence are unveiled during the course of ongoing supervision.

PARAGRAPH_81273: Directive (EU) 2019/878 of 20 May 2019 amends Directive 2013/36/EU as regards exempted entities, financial holding companies, mixed financial holding companies, remuneration, supervisory measures and powers and capital conservation measures. The new Directive is to be implemented by Member States by 28 December 2020. The EBA and ESMA issued Joint Guidelines on the Assessment of the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders in 2017. The Joint Guidelines have been amended to reflect the introduced changes.

PARAGRAPH_81274: B. Policy objectives

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:77]
PARAGRAPH_81275: These Guidelines are expected to contribute to the development of a single rule book and a level playing field for the EU banking and investment firm sectors and convergence of supervisory practices and outcomes38. As a joint mandate of the EBA and ESMA, these Guidelines are also expected to enhance cross-sectoral consistency and reduce potential risk originating from regulatory arbitrage within the EU financial system.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:77]
PARAGRAPH_81276: More specifically, these Guidelines aim to harmonise and improve the scope and the criteria used for the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body, heads of internal control functions and CFO, where they are not part of the management body, and other key function holders of credit institutions and investment firms in the EU, with a view to improving their internal governance and the performance and involvement of their management and internal control functions in credit institutions and investment firms.

PARAGRAPH_81287: C. Baseline scenario

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:78]
PARAGRAPH_81288: For credit institutions, the current EU legislative framework for the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders of financial institutions is based mainly on Directive 2013/36/EU. Directive 2014/65/EU entered into application on 3 January 2018 and aligned the requirements for the assessment of the suitability of the members of the management body with those applicable for credit institutions and investment firms subject to Directive 2013/36/EU (Article 9(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU that recalls Article 88 and 91 of Directive 2013/36/EU).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:78]
PARAGRAPH_81289: With regard to equal opportunities and non-discrimination the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights set the underlying framework.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:78]
PARAGRAPH_81290: The above requirements, further specified within the Joint Guidelines on the Assessment of the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders issued by the EBA and ESMA in 2017 and other EBA and ESMA Guidelines already in place (e.g. Guidelines on Internal Governance) form the baseline scenario.

PARAGRAPH_81291: D. Options considered

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:78]
PARAGRAPH_81292: Changes to the Guidelines are limited to changes introduced by Directive and to remedy weaknesses identified regarding the representation of the under-represented gender. Most changes are of a technical nature and concern the change of scope of application of Directive 2013/36/EU that applies also to financial and mixed financial holding companies and the amendments to Article 91 of that Directive, concerning the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing that have to be taken into account in the assessment. Regarding those changes no alternative options have been identified that require assessment.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:78]
PARAGRAPH_81293: Additional changes have been introduced in the section on diversity policy objectives. In its diversity benchmarking exercise the EBA found widespread weaknesses in institutions' diversity policies and in the representation of the under-represented gender.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:79] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_81304: The diversity benchmarking report of the EBA, published in early 2020, provides evidence that Option A alone would not be effective. Many institutions have not yet adopted diversity policies and gender diversity is not always included in diversity policies that have been adopted. There is also an insufficient representation of the under-represented gender in many institutions.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:79] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_81305: Therefore it is appropriate to set out additional expectations regarding measures that should be taken by institutions to ensure that the principle of equal opportunities, encoded in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, is respected. Those measures include, but are not limited to, career development plans, training, active reintegration of staff after maternity or parental leave and anti-discrimination measures. All those should facilitate a more diverse pool of candidates for management body positions and should help to improve diversity at the level of other staff with managerial responsibilities. All this should improve the decision-making processes in institutions.

The consultation was limited to the changes made to the guidelines previously in place.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:81] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_81329: Several respondents challenged the legal basis regarding the notion of key function holders. The EBA and ESMA must issue specific Guidelines whenever explicitly required under European Union law. This is the case for Articles 74(3) and Article 91 of Directive 2013/36/EU (CRD) and Article 9 of Directive 2014/65/EU, which mandates the EBA and ESMA to issue Guidelines on governance arrangements, processes and internal control mechanisms. In addition, Article 16 of EBA Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 lays down the general competence to issue Guidelines ensuring common, uniform and consistent application of Union law within its scope of action and effective supervisory practices within the ESFS. The same holds true for ESMA. The assessment of KFH is one necessary measure to ensure robust governance arrangements required by Article 74 of Directive 2013/36/EU and by Articles 9 and 16 of Directive 2014/65/EU. In light of the above, it is necessary to further specify the re-assessment triggers in light of the reinforced link between ML-TF risks and the prudential framework.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:81]
PARAGRAPH_81330: Many institutions had objections against the requirement that a member of the management board should be identified as being responsible for implementation of the requirements in Directive 2018/843 (AMLD V) on anti-money laundering and terrorist financing. Moreover, some respondents would prefer to remove the guidance provided in light of other upcoming EBA work on this topic.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:81] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_81331: The guidelines have been aligned with the requirements under AMLD V. Institutions' governance arrangements must take into account the risks that can emerge from being involved or being exploited in the context of money laundering and terrorist financing. The management body bears the overall responsibility for implementing the related policies and processes. However, many national laws, in line with AMLD V, indeed foresee that companies that are subject to AMLD V must identify one member of the management board, where such a body exists, as being responsible. The EBA is working on additional guidelines on AML compliance, while these Guidelines set out principles on the assessment of risks triggered by ML/TF risk factors during the assessment of the suitability of members of the management and key function holders.

PARAGRAPH_81351: Some respondents ask for confirmation that Article 16(2)(m) of the SSM Regulation is the legal basis. One respondent proposes deleting the amendment. Alternatively, it suggests redrafting considering that supervisory authorities can remove individual members solely due to e.g. matters of the collective gender equality in the management body, whereas Article 91(12)(e) of Directive 2013/36/EU specifically refers to the notion of diversity to be taken into account for the selection of members of the management body. Nor does Article 9 of Directive 2014/65/EU provide for competent authorities to remove members of management bodies on such grounds.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:82]
PARAGRAPH_81352: The legal basis is provided under Article 91 of the CRD as explicitly mentioned in those paragraphs. For MiFID firms, Article 9 refers explicitly to Article 91 of the CRD for the assessment of fit and proper members of the management body. Article 91 explicitly refers also to the removal power of CAs. This section reflects fully the text of CRD.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:82]
PARAGRAPH_81356: The wording 'offshore financial centres' repeats the wording used in Article 109 of the CRD. The use of this term in the Guidelines does not lead to a differentiation of elements between such centres and other third countries and therefore no definition is necessary.

PARAGRAPH_81382: Many respondents suggest proportionality in the application of the GL on the (sub-)consolidated basis, particularly for those entities not directly supervised by the ECB. Some respondents suggest limiting the application of the Guidelines only to subsidiaries that are themselves financial holding companies or mixed financial holding companies. Some suggest that the suitability assessment for non-regulated subsidiaries within the EU should be risk-based, since there may be cases where it is not proportional to request application of all the details.

PARAGRAPH_81383: Directive 2013/36/EU (CRD) applies on an individual, sub- consolidated or consolidated basis. The scope of prudential consolidation is specified within the CRR and includes all financial institutions within the scope of prudential consolidation. The principle of proportionality determines how regulatory requirements are applied in a proportionate way. Creating waivers within guidelines for entities in the scope of prudential consolidation is not possible under the existing legal framework. The consolidating institution is responsible for ensuring that the requirements in Title VII, Chapter 3, Section II of the CRD are met in the scope of consolidation, therefore all members of management

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:85] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_81438: Most respondents find the requirement disproportionate, because it widens the circumstances triggering suitability re- assessments beyond what would appear reasonable. E.g. as soon as a bank files a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR), regardless of whether the suspicion includes the involvement of one or more members of the management body; or in response to ML/TF originating externally, including all attempts by external actors, which would potentially require an endless series of re- assessments to be performed with a disproportionate and unreasonable level of frequency.

PARAGRAPH_81451: In view of the above, if the part is confirmed, in order to limit the triggering circumstances it is suggested to clarify that: (i) a review is needed only if there is evidence of significant or material and/or systematic ML/TF being carried out or attempted; (ii) a re-assessment is not necessary (and would be inappropriate or disproportionate) where there is no link between the suspected ML/TF and individual members of the management body, i.e. the risk is external to the institution. One respondent suggests limiting the re-assessment only to the member of the management body responsible for AML.

The guidelines have been further clarified, in particular the conditions that trigger a re-assessment. As specified in the Guidelines, in any case, any event that can otherwise materially affect the suitability of the member of the management body should trigger a re-assessment and it belongs to institutions to assess those events and be able to demonstrate it to the CAs if required.

PARAGRAPH_81453: The wording 'institution may or is exposed to' is in line with the CRD and AMLD. It is important that all institutions implement appropriate AML/CTF controls under the overall responsibility of the management body. Such events are not limited to the fact that a member of the management body is itself suspected to be involved in ML/TF activities. The management body bears the overall responsibility for compliance with AML/CTF requirements.

The EBA is aware about some specific legal structures and the resulting challenges. However, the CRD requirements apply to all institutions. Moreover, guidelines cannot be addressed to institutions that have a specific business model or legal form.

PARAGRAPH_81475: Some respondents complaint about the lack of legal basis in the CRD to set suitability requirements for key function holders. Therefore they do not support the inclusion of AML/CTF evaluations. It is also recalled that in the consultation launched by the European Commission (EC) on the final Basel III reforms, the EC has specifically addressed the fact that the current CRD framework does not provide for the assessment of KFH and has acknowledged that the Joint ESMA and EBA GL on suitability go further in this respect. It is suggested to refrain from introducing in the GL (additional) suitability requirements to KFH.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:87] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_81476: The EBA and ESMA must issue specific Guidelines whenever explicitly required under European Union law. This is the case for Articles 74(3) and Article 91 of Directive 2013/36/EU (CRD) and Article 9 of Directive 2014/65/EU, which mandates the EBA and ESMA to issue Guidelines on governance arrangements, processes and internal control mechanisms. In addition, Article 16 of EBA Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 lays down the general competence to issue Guidelines ensuring common, uniform and consistent application of Union law within its scope of action and effective supervisory practices within the ESFS. The same holds true for ESMA. The assessment of KFH is one necessary measure to ensure robust governance arrangements required by Article 74 of Directive 2013/36/EU and by Articles 9 and 16 of Directive 2014/65/EU. In light of the above, it is necessary to further specify the re-assessment triggers in light of the reinforced link between ML-TF risks and the prudential framework.

Therefore, those factors are to be considered for the purpose of the assessment of reputation, honesty and integrity. The same as above, information obtained via whistleblowing processes should be taken into account among all other factors. The reference is in line with the provisions of the CRD that set out a specific framework for whistleblowing.

PARAGRAPH_81546: Some respondents suggest that situations where a member of the management body is a 'politically exposed person' should not be considered as significant in terms of independence of mind, taking into account the extension of the definition. Furthermore, this would lead to the inclusion, for example, of situations where board members are members of the administrative, management or supervisory bodies of state- owned enterprises, which cannot be considered as detrimental to the independence of mind of a board member. In any case it is not clear if the positions held as 'PEP' in the past 12 months are considered in the draft as relevant. In this regard, it is suggested to make reference to the criteria adopted by the ECB in its guidance on fit and proper assessment where it is specified that 'the materiality of the conflict of interest depends on whether there are specific powers or obligations inherent in the political role which would hinder the appointee from acting in the interest of the supervised entity'.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:91]
PARAGRAPH_81561: Several requests for clarifications are submitted, mainly aimed at specifying (i) the meaning of 'member' of affiliated companies and the definition of 'affiliated'; (ii) if 'membership' is to be understood as 'member of the management body'; (iii) that it does not apply to those members of the management body in its supervisory function which are representatives of municipal trustees, as the situation is comparable to that of shareholder representatives / shareholders and therefore equal treatment should be applied.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:91]
PARAGRAPH_81562: There is no definition within the CRD of the term 'affiliated companies'. However, the CRD makes reference to affiliated companies that are permanently affiliated to a central body or affiliated companies that are affiliated to the same institutional protection scheme. Member refers to members of the management body of a company and members of cooperative banks that are affiliated to the institution, where the member of the management body holds a directorship in the management or supervisory function. The EBA is aware of those specific situations and in this case a representative of municipal trustees who is appointed as a member of the management body by law cannot be considered as independent. Nonetheless, the member can be a non-independent member and be independent of mind and meet the suitability criteria.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:92]
PARAGRAPH_81580: Some respondents expressed concerns about the application in smaller institutions, where management bodies often comprise only two members. A gender-balanced composition would mean that one board member would always have to be a woman. For purely factual reasons, this goal is not always achievable. For the sake of proportionality, one respondent suggests that this regulation should not be relevant for non-CRD investment firms that have one or two managing directors. Requests for clarification are submitted on if (i) this is to be measured within the group as a whole, on aggregate level, or per board; (ii) there is a defined percentage of gender representation to fulfil the requirement to ensure 'that the principle of equal opportunities is respected when selecting members of the management body'.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:92]
PARAGRAPH_81581: While institutions need to take into account the gender balance when recruiting new members of the management body, there are no hard elements in the Guidelines that specifies a certain minimum representation.

It is evidenced that, since employee representatives in the management body facilitate a diverse composition of the board, it is not clear what the rationale is behind not accepting them for ensuring gender balance. Alternatively, if the sentence is not deleted, it is suggested to not refer to the supervisory function of the management body but rather the management body in general, meaning both executive and supervisory function (i.e. 'Having employee representatives, where required under national law, of the

PARAGRAPH_81585: While it is true that the staff representatives add to the diversity of the management body, institutions must under Art. 91 of the CRD take into account diversity when recruiting members of the management body. Staff representatives are elected by staff, they are elected independently of a diversity policy adopted by the management body. Furthermore, Article 88 (2) requires that the nomination committee in significant institutions shall decide on a target for the representation of the under-represented gender in the management body and prepare a policy on how to increase the number of the under-represented gender in the management body in order to meet that target. Also in this context the institution cannot depend on the staff to elect members of the under-represented gender.

PARAGRAPH_81598: Therefore to ensure a gender balanced composition is achieved in line with the diversity policy of the institution, the institution must implement measures that do not depend on a certain outcome of the election of staff representatives. The reference to management body includes both functions and allows for more flexibility than requiring at each board a gender balance. However, this would be the most agreeable situation, but is often difficult to achieve in small boards.

There exist concerns that situations may raise in which there is a conflict between this requirement and local rules (e.g. gender balance). Therefore it is pointed out that the Guidelines should not impose or expect the same standards or suitability policies in subsidiaries located in third countries, not only because group policies will have to account for a wide array of legal frameworks, but likewise because subsidiaries will likely have very different risk profiles, business models, size, internal organisation, complexity, etc. Third country subsidiaries will have their own processes or procedures and specificities to be respected, it might raise a

PARAGRAPH_81663: Regarding involvement in past ML-TF cases of members of the management body, this assessment should also be done when assessing the reputation, honesty and integrity criteria as specified in the Guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:96]
PARAGRAPH_81665: One respondent suggests deleting this since it lacks a legal basis in the CRD. The effect of proposed para. 152 exceeds the scope of the changes introduced by the level 1 text, and would impose obligations on institutions which are unparalleled in comparison with any other risk under analysis by the management body. 'Reasonable grounds to suspect that money laundering or terrorist financing is being committed or attempted' is an issue with potentially no link to the suitability of directors. In the case of ML/TF risk, the assessment would have to be done regarding the individual and collective knowledge, skills and experience to adequately comprehend said risk. Isolated facts or increased risk, as such, cannot be linked directly to a suitability deficit or loss, whether pertaining to ML/FT risk or any other risk. The respondent refers to para. 15 that clarifies that any references to 'risks' in these Guidelines should also include money laundering and terrorist financing risk and therefore its content is understood to be covered in para. 66. The modified Article 91 of the CRD focuses on ensuring that suitability persists upon the occurrence of certain events, i.e. when there are reasonable grounds that ML/TF are taking place or have taken place in the institution, but the underlying obligation of suitability has not been altered. It is questionable whether institutions should demonstrate more understanding

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:96] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_81666: Institutions and competent authorities should be aware of the negative impact on an institution in the event of a possible involvement of a member of the management body and/or a key function holder in ML/TF, or where the institution fails to take robust action to manage the risk of being involved in ML/TF. Together with the authorities and bodies responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering requirements under Directive (EU) 2015/849, prudential supervisors have an important role to play in identifying and tackling weaknesses in institutions' AML/CFT systems and controls. In this context, the Guidelines clarify in line with Directive 2013/36/EU that the knowledge, experience and skill requirements of at least the member of the management body who is responsible for the implementation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with AMLD include identifying, managing and mitigating money laundering and financing of terrorism risk. Also other members need to have some knowledge in this area, which can e.g. be achieved via training. The Guidelines also clarify that the ability to understand ML/TF risks is part of the assessments of the collective suitability of the members of the management body and the assessment of key function holders. This is in line with the CRD and the EBA mandate in this regard.

Another respondent suggests that the reference to 'decisions' should be corrected, as matters linked to ML/TF will not always entail a decision, in many instances they will be subject to analysis, supervision and control, not necessarily involving a specific decision.

Fit and proper requirements under the CRD and MIFID for members of the management body play an important role in this regard as the management body bears the overall responsibility for the institution. The purpose of those paragraphs are that the management body, when performing its tasks, should be able to consider ML-FT risks in the same way as any other risks.

PARAGRAPH_81712: Another respondent claims that the EBA's reference to Article 74 as a legal basis for suitability assessment of the key function holders is a very extensive interpretation, provided that there is a more restrictive specific clause (lex specialis) in Article 91. Especially in cooperative banking groups the draft revised Guidelines regarding the suitability assessment of key function holders are too categorical. The guidance regarding key function holders should at least clearly provide that the requirement on suitability assessment of key function holders only applies to the central institution/parent entity level in banking groups where the main responsibility of the said functions is centralized and not to require the assessment of key function holders at the level of local and regional cooperative banks. An equally restrictive approach should be applied to less significant institutions in general. The same approach should be
