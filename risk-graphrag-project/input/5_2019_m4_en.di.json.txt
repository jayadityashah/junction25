PARAGRAPH_28157: (1) In accordance with Article 26(3) of the CRR, competent authorities shall evaluate whether issuances of capital instruments satisfy the criteria set out in Article 28 or, where applicable, Article 29. Institutions may classify capital instruments as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) instruments only after permission is granted by the competent authorities.

PARAGRAPH_28162: (4) On the basis of information collected from competent authorities, the EBA shall maintain and publish a list of all forms of capital instruments in each Member State that qualify as Common Equity Tier 1 instruments. In Finland, instruments qualifying for the list comprise shares with classes carrying entitlement to different voting rights, cooperative shares (osuus), non-voting shares (äänivallaton osuus) and basic fund shares (kantarahasto-osuus). Even if a CET1 instrument has the same legal form as an instrument mentioned in the EBA's list, the inclusion of new instruments into CET1 must be based either on a classification permission or the notification procedure under paragraph (2). Where an entirely new category of CET1 instrument is concerned, institutions should be prepared for a permission procedure lasting for several months, since the processing of a permission requires that an opinion is requested from the EBA.
