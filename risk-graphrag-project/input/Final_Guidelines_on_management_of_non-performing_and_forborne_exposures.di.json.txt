[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_71745: The financial crisis negatively affected the European banking sector and contributed to a build-up of non-performing exposures (NPEs) on many banks' balance sheets. Although the joint efforts of banks, supervisors, regulators and macroprudential authorities have led to a slow improvement in NPE ratios in recent years, the overall level of NPEs remains high by historic standards, especially in some jurisdictions. In July 2017, the European Council concluded an Action Plan1 to tackle non- performing loans (NPLs) in Europe. The Council stressed that a comprehensive approach consisting of a mix of complementary policy actions, at national and European level, was needed to address the existing stock of NPLs as well as to prevent the emergence and accumulation of new NPEs on banks' balance sheets. In this regard, the EBA, along with other bodies and institutions, was invited by the Council to contribute to this Action Plan in four specific areas: (i) supervisory actions to work with banks to improve strategies to reduce NPEs; (ii) measures to improve the functioning of the secondary market; (iii) structural measures to improve the environment for dealing with NPEs; and (iv) fostering restructuring of the banking system. These guidelines relate to the first area.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_71746: The guidelines are aimed primarily at reducing NPEs on banks' balance sheets by providing supervisory guidance to ensure that credit institutions effectively manage NPEs and forborne exposures (FBEs) on their balance sheets. The aim is to achieve a sustainable reduction of NPEs on credit institutions' balance sheets by means of the institutions' own NPE strategies, which would prove beneficial from both micro and macro perspectives. The guidelines are written from a prudential perspective but also taking into account the pressing need to ensure that consumers who have taken out loans are treated fairly at every stage of the loan life cycle. To that end, the guidelines draw attention specifically to provisions under the EU directives and relevant EBA guidelines relating to consumers of which credit institutions need to be cognisant when managing NPEs.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_71747: The development and operationalisation of an NPE strategy is the core building block of the guidelines for banks' NPE management. The NPE strategy should be built on an assessment of the operating environment, should set out time-bound, credible yet ambitious reduction targets and should consider all available strategic options to reduce NPEs. The guidelines outline the proportionate approach to the key elements of governance and operations in relation to an NPE workout framework, covering aspects related to steering and decision-making, the NPE operating model, the internal control framework and NPE monitoring processes. Credit institutions with gross NPL ratios at a level of 5% or above should establish an NPE strategy, as part of their overall strategy, and related governance and operational arrangements. Effective governance covers all the responsibilities that banks have, including treating customers fairly.

PARAGRAPH_71748: The guidelines stress that any forbearance measures should be granted only when they aim to restore sustainable repayment by the borrower and are thus in the borrower's interests. These

PARAGRAPH_71754: guidelines set out requirements relating to processes for recognising NPEs and FBEs, as well as a forbearance-granting process with a focus on the viability of forbearance measures. Credit institutions are expected to monitor the efficiency and effectiveness of forbearance measures and have in place policies and processes to assess borrowers' financial difficulties and identify NPEs.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_71755: The guidelines set out guidance on the estimation of future cash flow resulting from an active workout of the exposure and/or the sale of collateral, and require credit institutions to have in place policies for timely impairments and write-offs. The management of NPEs secured by movable or immovable property collateral requires credit institutions to have in place governance arrangements, procedures, including on methodology and frequency, and controls on the valuation of the collateral.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_71756: The guidelines also set out requirements for competent authorities' assessments of credit institutions' NPE management activities.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_71764: 1. The financial crisis negatively affected the European banking sector in various ways, and it contributed to the build-up of a large stock of non-performing exposures (NPEs) on banks' balance sheets. The stock of non-performing loans (NPLs) in the EU banking sector amounted to EUR 989 billion at the end of 2016, EUR 815 billion at the end of 2017 and EUR 779 billion in the first quarter of 2018, i.e. 5.4%, 4.1% and 3.9% respectively of the total loan portfolio. The EU average NPE ratio was 3.4% in the first quarter of 2018.2

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_71765: 2. The dispersion of the stock of NPEs is uneven across Member States. There are currently 12 Member States experiencing above average NPE ratios, and the scale and the cross-border implications make this an EU-wide problem. The overall level remains high by historic standards, even though the joint efforts of banks, supervisors and macroprudential authorities have led to a slow improvement in NPE ratios over recent years.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_71766: 3. The EBA's risk analysis, supported by similar research conducted by other international organisations, indicated that high levels of NPEs are a drag on profitability and are strongly correlated with weak lending growth. The effects of high levels of NPEs on banks' balance sheets on, inter alia, funding costs and capital and profitability can seriously jeopardise institutions' ability to run a viable and sustainable business model.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6] [RISK:SYSTEMIC_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_71767: 4. NPEs are a problem at multiple levels: at microprudential level, high levels of NPEs are associated with lower profitability and lower efficiency; at macroprudential level, high levels of NPEs are connected with stagnant growth, as capital is tied up in NPEs and there is decreased new lending into the real economy. In addition, high stocks of NPEs negatively affect the resilience of the banking sector to shocks and hence increase systemic risk. Finally, for consumers, an inability to meet the obligations of the credit contract could have a detrimental impact on their financial situation and social circumstances. All of these effects must be tackled in a comprehensive manner.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_71768: 5. In 2014, in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 on supervisory reporting the EBA introduced definitions of NPEs and forborne exposures (FBEs) to facilitate the identification of problematic assets. Despite the decreasing trend in levels of NPEs in most EU Member States, the pace of reduction of NPLs has been slow. This slow pace of reduction is mainly due to the discretion allowed banks' management and supervisors, together with the absence of an effective secondary market for NPEs and challenging legal systems, which have incentivised credit institutions to keep the loans on their balance sheets.

PARAGRAPH_71774: 6. In July 2017, the European Council concluded an Action Plan3 to tackle NPLs in Europe. The Council stressed that a comprehensive approach consisting of a mix of complementary policy actions, at national level and at European level where appropriate, was the most effective way to address the existing stock of NPEs, as well as the emergence and accumulation of new NPEs, on banks' balance sheets. The policy actions were to cover the following four policy areas: (i) supervision, (ii) development of secondary markets for distressed assets, (iii) structural reforms of insolvency and debt recovery frameworks and (iv) restructuring of the banking system. These guidelines relate to the first area.

PARAGRAPH_71775: Objective and structure of the guidelines

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_71776: 7. The main body of the guidelines is structured in six sections, with section 4 introducing the requirements for the NPE strategy, and section 5 providing details on the operationalisation of the strategy and outlines supporting governance and operational arrangements. Section 6 sets out supervisory expectations regarding the use of forbearance, section 7 addresses the recognition of NPEs, section 8 deals with NPE impairments and write-offs, and section 9 specifies supervisory requirements regarding the collateral valuation of movable and immovable property. Furthermore, section 10 provides guidance to the competent authorities on addressing NPEs and FBEs in the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_71777: 8. The NPE strategy is the core building block of the guidelines for the banks' NPE management. The strategy sets the basis for the credit institutions' initial and regular assessments of the operating environment and describes the considerations that they should take into account. These include the internal capabilities of the credit institution, external conditions and capital implications. When developing their NPE strategy, credit institutions should also consider all available strategic options and combinations of them. These include hold/forbearance strategies, active portfolio reductions, taking collateral onto the balance sheet and legal options including out-of-court options. Furthermore, implementing the operational plan and embedding the NPE strategy into the institution are both important aspects of the NPE strategy. The guidelines call for regular review of the strategy, monitoring of its operational effectiveness and integration of it into the credit institution's risk management framework.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_71778: 9. Credit institutions need to address NPEs in an efficient and sustainable way. Therefore, an appropriate governance structure and operational set-up should be in place to facilitate this objective. The guidelines outline the key elements of governance and operations in relation to an NPE workout framework, covering key aspects related to steering and decision-making, the NPE operating model, the internal control framework and NPE monitoring processes.

This threshold is not intended to indicate any optimal level of NPLs that credit institutions should aim for on their balance sheets and should not be considered an automatic quantitative target to be used in credit institutions' NPE strategies. NPE strategies should target a time-bound reduction of NPEs over a realistic but sufficiently ambitious time horizon. Competent authorities could identify other credit institutions that should develop NPE strategies, governance and operations if they detect signs of deteriorating asset quality.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_71786: 11. The level of a 5% gross NPL ratio aims to ensure a minimum level of transparency, and to ensure that credit institutions are prepared to prevent NPEs building up and to take action at an early stage to tackle the issue. The rationale behind applying an NPL threshold is that the majority of exposures on credit institutions' balance sheets that have become non- performing are loans; therefore, a calculation that is based on the share of NPLs better depicts the evolution of asset quality overall and is more risk based. Sections 4 and 5, when triggered, would apply to all material NPEs, including debt securities.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_71787: 12. The computation of the gross NPL ratio is defined in the EBA Risk Dashboard. For the NPL ratio, the gross carrying amount of NPLs and advances is divided by the gross carrying amount of total loans and advances subject to the NPE definition.4

PARAGRAPH_71803: 19.In accordance with Article 97 of Directive 2013/36/EU, competent authorities should review the arrangements, strategies, processes and mechanisms implemented by credit institutions to determine whether the own funds and liquidity held by them ensure a sound management and coverage of their risk. Competent authorities, when conducting the SREP, must review whether credit institutions observe the provisions of these guidelines. As an outcome of the SREP, and in accordance with Article 104(1)(d) of Directive 2013/36/EU, competent authorities may require an institution to apply a specific provisioning policy, which may - where permitted by accounting rules and regulations - result in an increase in impairments, or the need to hold additional own funds.

PARAGRAPH_71811: 23. The evidence from wide-ranging asset quality reviews conducted by competent authorities in recent years highlights gaps in credit institutions' credit risk assessment and management practices. Therefore, these guidelines respond to a legitimate supervisory need to equip credit institutions with a comprehensive set of requirements that should be considered when devising their NPE management framework.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:10]
PARAGRAPH_71812: 24. The objective of the guidelines is to increase the convergence of NPE and FBE management practices across EU Member States, by clarifying how credit institutions should effectively manage and ultimately reduce their non-performing and forborne exposures through the establishment and operationalisation of an NPL strategy that is embedded in the credit institution's overall strategy.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:10]
PARAGRAPH_71813: 25. The guidelines, together with the guidelines on loan origination that the EBA has also been invited to issue by the Council's Action Plan, aim to address the existing stock of NPLs and to prevent the accumulation of NPLs in the future.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:10]
PARAGRAPH_71814: 26. The provisions of the guidelines should be read in conjunction with and without prejudice to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 on supervisory reporting, which provides harmonised NPE and FBE definitions for prudential reporting purposes; these are applied consistently across these guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:10]
PARAGRAPH_71815: 27.Credit institutions are expected to apply these guidelines as of 30 June 2019 on the basis of the gross NPL ratios calculated at 31 December 2018. The application of sections 4 and 5 will depend on the credit institutions' NPL ratios in relation to the levels specified in these guidelines and within supervisory dialogue, which will also consider the institutions' own NPE strategies (including any NPL ratio targets set therein).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:10] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_71816: 28. The guidelines should be applied in a proportionate manner and, in particular, organisational aspects of the management of NPEs and FBEs should be applied taking into account the size and complexity of the institution. Large and more complex institutions should have more sophisticated governance arrangements, policies, processes and procedures, while small and less complex institutions may implement simpler governance arrangements, policies, processes and procedures in accordance with the EBA Guidelines on internal governance.

In the context of determining the days past due, these guidelines refer to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/171 on the materiality threshold for past due credit obligations, which has been adopted by the European Commission and published in the Official Journal6; it sets out the methodology for calculating the days past due.

PARAGRAPH_72113: a) Early arrears (up to 90 days past due):23 during this phase, the focus should be on initial engagement with the borrower for early recoveries and on collecting information to enable a detailed assessment of the borrower's circumstances (e.g. financial position, status of loan documentation, status of collateral, level of cooperation, etc.). The type of exposure and collateral should ultimately determine the most suitable workout strategy, which may involve forbearance measures with a short-term time horizon, to be applied when necessary (including during this initial period, where appropriate), with the aim of stabilising the financial position of the borrower before establishing a suitable workout strategy. In addition, the credit institution should, where appropriate, seek options to improve its position while taking into account the rights and interests of consumers (e.g. by signing new loan documents, perfecting outstanding collateral, minimising cash leakage, taking additional collateral if available). A dedicated arrears management policy should contain guidance on the overall NPE workout procedures and responsibilities, including handover triggers.

PARAGRAPH_72114: b) Late arrears/forbearance: credit institutions should implement and formalise forbearance arrangements with borrowers in this phase. Forbearance arrangements should be put into place only where the credit institution is satisfied that the borrower can afford to make the repayments. In considering whether a restructuring option is viable, credit institutions should have regard to Article 28 of Directive 2014/17/EU24 and other legal provisions aimed at protecting consumers, to the extent applicable. A forbearance arrangement should be monitored for at least one year in line with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, given the increased risk, before it can eventually be transferred out of the NPE WUs if no further NPE triggers are observed.

Based on this analysis, credit institutions should speedily proceed with the chosen liquidation option, supported by legal and business liquidation expertise. Credit institutions that are engaged in extensive use of external experts should ensure that sufficient internal control mechanisms are in place to ensure an effective and efficient liquidation process.

PARAGRAPH_72135: 78.Based on the findings of the credit institution's NPE self-assessment on capabilities, as referred to in section 4.2.1, credit institutions should regularly review the adequacy of their internal and external NPE workout resources and address any human resourceng gaps in a timely fashion. As workout activities may place significant demands on resources, credit institutions should consider if it is appropriate to choose to use fixed-term contracts, internal/external outsourcing or joint ventures for NPE workout activities. However, the final responsibility for these activities remains with the credit institution. In the event that outsourcing is used, credit institutions should ensure that such outsourcing is arranged in accordance with the applicable legislation or regulatory requirements.

PARAGRAPH_72244: 115. The main objective of forbearance measures should be the return of the borrower to a sustainable performing repayment status, taking into account the amount due and minimising expected losses. This objectives should take into account the importance of ensuring the fair treatment of consumers and compliance with any consumer protection requirements that may be applicable. The credit institution should monitor the quality of the forbearance activities to make sure that they are not used to delay impairments or an assessment that the exposure is uncollectable. The monitoring should cover forbearance activities in relation to both performing and non-performing exposures.

PARAGRAPH_72246: 116. If no sustainable restructuring solution can be reached, credit institutions should still resolve the NPE. Resolution may involve initiating legal procedures, foreclosing assets, debt to asset/equity swap, disposal of credit facilities by sale, transferal to an asset management company or securitisation. Where the price obtained from the foreclosure of immovable property affects the amount owed by a consumer, credit institutions should take into account, when deciding on the liquidation measure and next steps, the provisions of Article 17(5) of Directive 2014/17/EU,31 to the extent applicable.

Credit institutions should carefully monitor cases where the debt is swapped with an asset or equity of the borrower, at least by using volume indicators by type of assets, and ensure compliance with any limits set by the relevant national regulations on holdings. The use of this approach as a forbearance measure should be backed by a proper business plan and limited to assets in relation to which the institution has sufficient expertise and the market realistically allows the determined value to be extracted from the asset in the short to medium term. The institution should also make sure that the valuation of the assets is carried out by qualified and experienced appraisers.

The regular assessment of the borrower's repayment capabilities should also apply to bullet loans, because these loans represent a higher level of risk than a loan subject to regular amortisation and also because continuous payment by the borrower of the interest amounts due is not sufficient reason to assume that the final bullet repayment of the loan will take place.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:44]
PARAGRAPH_72346: 150. For the purpose of implementing forbearance measures, credit institutions should be able to identify signs of possible future financial difficulties at an early stage. In order to do so, the assessment of the financial situation of the borrower should not be limited to exposures with apparent signs of financial difficulties. An assessment of financial difficulties should also be conducted for exposures with regard to which the borrower does not have apparent financial difficulties but in relation to which market conditions have changed significantly in a way that could impact the borrower's ability to repay (e.g. bullet loans the repayment of which will depend on the sale of immovable property or foreign currency loans).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:44]
PARAGRAPH_72347: 151. The assessment of any financial difficulties on the part of a borrower should be based on the situation of the borrower only, disregarding collateral or any guarantees provided by third parties. When assessing the financial difficulties of the borrower, credit institutions, in accordance with Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, should consider at least the following rebuttable circumstances:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:44]

PARAGRAPH_72357: 153. Granting new conditions such as a new interest rate more favourable than the rate borrowers with a similar risk profile could obtain may be considered an indication of such a concession when the credit institution determines that the reason for the new rate is the financial difficulties of the borrower. The provision of more favourable new conditions than those practised by the market should not be considered a prerequisite for the identification of concessions and therefore forbearance. In line with Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, when a borrower is in financial difficulties, a change in conditions in line with what other borrowers with a similar risk profile could get from the credit institution should qualify as a concession, including when borrowers are included in public forbearance schemes that are offered by credit institutions.

PARAGRAPH_72358: 154. Borrowers may request modifications in the contractual conditions of their loans without facing or being about to face difficulties in meeting their financial commitments.

PARAGRAPH_72360: 155. When granting forbearance measures to performing exposures, credit institutions should assess whether these measures lead to a need to reclassify the exposure as non-performing. Granting forbearance measures to NPEs does not clear their non-performing status: the exposures should continue to be identified as non-performing for at least one year of the cure period after the granting of the forbearance measures, as specified in Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 and in section 7.3.3.

PARAGRAPH_72370: 157. Credit institutions should reclassify NPEs, including FBEs, as performing in accordance with Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014.

PARAGRAPH_72371: 158. Credit institutions' policies for the reclassification of non-performing FBEs should specify practices for dispelling concerns regarding the borrower's ability to comply with the post- forbearance conditions set out in Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014. These policies should establish criteria in terms of payments made during the cure period of at least one year and define the borrower's ability to comply with post- forbearance conditions (to the extent that full repayment of the debt is likely) without being reliant on the realisation of collateral at least by demonstrating payments of a not insignificant amount of principal. These policies should require payments of both principal and interest.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:46] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_72372: 159. In addition, where a borrower has other exposures to a credit institution that are not the subject of a forbearance measure, the credit institution should consider the impact and the performance of these exposures in its assessment of the borrower's ability to comply with post-forbearance conditions. The consideration of arrears should not change the level of application of non-performing status, in accordance with Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, and only exposures to which forbearance measures have been applied should be identified as FBEs.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:46]
PARAGRAPH_72373: 160. The existence of contract terms that extend the repayment period, such as grace periods for the principal, should confirm the classification of these FBEs as non-performing until the requirements of Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 have been satisfied. The fact that the one-year cure period has elapsed should not automatically lead to reclassification to performing unless regular payments have been made over these 12 months and an assessment of unlikeliness to pay has been concluded with no indication of unlikeliness to pay.

Once FBEs are classified as performing, either because they have met the conditions for being reclassified from the non-performing category or because the granting of forbearance measures did not lead to the classification of the exposure as non-performing, they should continue to be identified as forborne until all the conditions for the discontinuation of the classification of exposures as forborne under paragraph 256 of Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 have been met.

PARAGRAPH_72395: 169. In accordance with the EBA Guidelines on credit risk management practices and accounting for expected credit losses,37 uncollectability should be recognised in the appropriate period through loss allowances or write-offs. When the credit institution has no reasonable expectation of recovering contractual cash flow of the exposure it should lead to a partial or full write-off of the exposure (IFRS 9.B3.2.16.r).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:48]
PARAGRAPH_72396: 170. A write-off may be done before legal actions against the borrower to recover the debt have been concluded in full.

PARAGRAPH_72516: 220. All credit institutions should develop their own liquidation cost and market price discount assumptions based on observed empirical evidence. If insufficient empirical evidence is available, discount assumptions should be based on, at a minimum, liquidity, passage of time, and the quality/ageing of the appraisal. If a credit institution faces the situation of a frozen property market and only a small number of properties have been sold or the sales history has to be considered insufficient, a more conservative market price discount should apply.

PARAGRAPH_72518: 221. In estimating cash flow from property collateral liquidation, credit institutions should use appropriate and credible assumptions. In addition, credit institutions should pay attention to the requirements for valuing cash flow under IFRS 13 on fair value measurements. In particular, financial institutions should comply with the following requirements:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:55] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]

PARAGRAPH_72525: c) They must ensure that income from property collateral is not assumed to increase from the current levels unless there is an existing contractual arrangement for such an increase. Moreover, current income from property should be adjusted when calculating cash flow in order to reflect the expected economic conditions. Credit institutions should consider whether it is appropriate to project a flat income in a recessionary environment in which vacant properties are increasing and/or demand for transportation is decreasing, putting downwards pressure on income.

PARAGRAPH_72534: 224. Credit institutions should be able to substantiate the assumptions used when assessing the recoverable amount by providing to the competent authority, if requested, details on the property market value, the market price discount, legal and selling expenses applied, and the term used for the time to liquidation. Credit institutions should be able to fully justify their assumptions, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and explain the drivers of their expectations, taking past and current experience into account.

PARAGRAPH_72550: 229. Credit institutions should strongly consider classifying foreclosed assets as non-current assets held for sale under IFRS 5. This accounting treatment implies that the asset must be available for immediate sale in its present condition (IFRS 5.7), that the management body should approve an individual plan to sell the asset within a short timeframe (normally one year) and that an active sales policy should be pursued (IFRS 5.8); thus, it favours recoveries.

PARAGRAPH_72560: b) The volume or level of activity of the markets in relation to these assets. The credit institution's previous experience of the entity in realisations and of the differences between amounts arrived at using the valuation technique and the final amounts obtained in realisations should be incorporated into the calculation. The assumptions made in order to measure this adjustment may be documented, and should be available to the supervisor on request. Illiquidity discounts may be considered.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:58]
PARAGRAPH_72561: 232. When credit institutions' foreclosed assets are still under construction and it is decided to complete construction before selling the asset, they should demonstrate the merits of such a strategy and the cost should not exceed the fair value less costs to complete and sell the asset taking into account an appropriate illiquidity discount as described above.

PARAGRAPH_72562: 233. When a foreclosed asset has exceeded the average holding period for similar assets for which active sales policies are in place, credit institutions should revise the illiquidity discount applied in the valuation process described above, increase it accordingly. In these circumstances, the credit institution should refrain from recognising write-backs/reversals of existing accumulated impairment on the asset, as its prolonged presence on the balance sheet provides evidence that the credit institution is unable to sell the asset at an increased valuation.

PARAGRAPH_72569: 235. As part of their ongoing engagement with credit institutions under the SREP, competent authorities should monitor the application of these guidelines by the credit institutions, in particular the development and implementation of NPE strategies and related governance and operational frameworks as described in sections 4 and 5. Competent authorities' assessments should include, but not be limited to, whether the credit institution's NPE strategy:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:59]
PARAGRAPH_72570: a) is embedded into the credit institution's overall strategy and is subject to appropriate NPE governance, including a risk management and control framework;

PARAGRAPH_72574: e) includes time-bound, realistic yet ambitious quantitative NPE targets and foreclosed assets targets where appropriate and is supported by an operational plan.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:59]
PARAGRAPH_72575: 236. If the competent authority concludes that the NPE strategy of a credit institution clearly lacks one or more of the elements listed in points (a) to (e) of paragraph 235, it should be considered a serious shortcoming of the NPE strategy. In this case, competent authorities should require the immediate revision of the NPE strategy.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:59] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_72576: 237. If the outcome of the competent authority's assessment is that the requirements of point (a) to (e) of paragraph 236 are broadly fulfilled by the NPE strategy, but some deficiencies are identified, the competent authority should ensure that credit institutions present an action plan on how to address the deficiencies and establish an effective and timely NPE management framework.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:59]
PARAGRAPH_72577: 238. Competent authorities should apply supervisory evaluation proportionately, taking into account the specificities of the institutions (e.g. in terms of size, nature and complexity). In their SREP assessments of NPE strategies and the supporting governance and operational arrangements, the competent authorities should consider also the business models of the institutions, in particular when the sole business of the institution is the purchase and sale of NPEs.

PARAGRAPH_72582: 239. Proportionality in terms of the supervisory assessment of the NPE strategy of a smaller and less complex credit institution (e.g. an SREP Category 3 or 4 institution40) can be achieved by aligning the assessment with the SREP engagement model, which ensures a risk-based approach to supervision and takes into account the systemic importance of global and domestic institutions.

The measure should generally not exceed a period of 24 months and, in the case of construction of commercial property and project finance, 12 months. Once the defined period of this forbearance measure is over, institutions should reassess the borrower's debt- servicing capacity in order to proceed with a revised repayment schedule that is able to account for the unpaid capital element during this interest-only period. In most cases, this measure will be offered in combination with other measures of a longer-term nature to compensate for the temporary lower repayments (e.g. extension of maturity).

PARAGRAPH_72937: The measure should be granted/considered viable only where the institution has assessed that the borrower's verified income/expenditure levels (based on reasonable documented financial information) and the proposed revised repayments are sufficient to enable the borrower to service the revised loan repayment on a principal and interest basis for the duration of the revised repayment schedule, and where the institution has formally sought confirmation that the borrower understands and accepts the capitalisation conditions. Arrears capitalisation should be provided only selectively in cases where the recovery of historical arrears or payments due under the contract is not possible and capitalisation is the only option realistically available. Institutions should generally avoid offering this measure to a borrower more than once, and the measure should be applied only to arrears that do not exceed a predefined size relative to the overall principal (which should be defined in the credit institution's forbearance policy). The institution should assess the percentage of arrears being capitalised compared with the principal and interest repayments as adequate and appropriate for the borrower.

In such cases, an interest rate reduction could be considered.

PARAGRAPH_73004: As per Article 16(2) of the EBA Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council), any guidelines developed by the EBA must be accompanied by an impact assessment (IA) that analyses 'the potential related costs and benefits'. This IA must provide the reader with an overview of the findings as regards the problem identification, the options identified to remove the problem and their potential impacts.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:80]
PARAGRAPH_73007: The main (specific) problem that the current guidelines aim to address is the limitations on the scope of implementation of the SSM guidance. The SSM guidance covers a set of microprudential measures and supervisory tools for monitoring and assessing the performance of significant institutions under the SSM's direct supervision regarding their strategy, governance and operations in relation to NPL management. In other words, the current scope of the policy implementation on NPL management is limited to significant institutions (and to their national, European and international subsidiaries) and does not cover other (less significant) institutions and banks outside the Banking Union. Yet there may be some other banks that are not subject to the SSM guidance that continue to have high levels of NPLs.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:80]
PARAGRAPH_73008: Overall, the exclusion of the banks that fall outside the scope of the SSM's direct supervision from NPE management rules prevents the achievement of the ultimate policy objectives of tackling the high NPE levels in the EU.43 This could lead to:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:84]
PARAGRAPH_73287: The assessment looked at the loans and exposure categories of banks to be included in the scope of the guidelines. Supervisory data show that NPLs, NPEs to households and NPEs to non-financial corporates (NFCs) are the major categories in which banks have critical risk ratios. Option 1a proposes including these categories. Option 1b suggests that, regardless of the current dynamics in the risk profiles of banks in relation to any loan or exposure category, the scope of implementation should cover the entire non-performing and forbearance scope of definition.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:84]
PARAGRAPH_73288: The EBA selected option 1b because it is expected to be more prudential and forward looking, i.e. although currently data do not indicate any major risk in exposure classes other than loans, households and NFCs, this may not be the case in the future. Therefore, the guidelines apply to all instruments and sectors - to exposures that meet the definition of NPEs or FBEs in Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:85]
PARAGRAPH_73296: The options require an assessment of whether the current guidelines introduce a balance between the policy requirements and the characteristics of the institutions, i.e. whether the policy requirements for the institutions are appropriate and fair given a set of criteria.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:85] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_73297: The application of the proportionality principle (option 2a) is intended to introduce a framework that requires that institutions comply with the NPE strategy, governance and operational requirements in proportion to their characteristics.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:85]
PARAGRAPH_73298: More precisely, it aims to avoid disproportionately large (administrative and operational) costs for institutions in relation to their characteristics, such as their size, internal organisation, and the nature, scope and complexity of their activities.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:85]
PARAGRAPH_73299: For example, the implementation of separate and dedicated NPE WUs might be disproportionately costly for a small institution with less complex and more local business activities than for a large international institution with a more complex set of portfolios. Therefore, the guidelines introduce simplified requirements for some banks. These banks, meeting certain proportionality criteria, may not need to or be able to set out a separate WU but need only to separate certain tasks. In addition, for small banks that do not have internal models, it would be costly to meet requirements for advanced back-testing. Therefore, guidelines introduce simplified requirements for small banks that do not use internal models. This application of proportionality applies also in other technical areas, such as the definition of borrower subportfolios.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:85]
PARAGRAPH_73300: However, the recognition and accounting aspects presented in sections 6, 7 and 8 of the guidelines do not justify differing treatment among banks and apply to all institutions regardless of the proportionality assessment criteria.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:85]
PARAGRAPH_73301: The application of the proportionality principle does not refer to the risk profiles of the institutions (which depend in this case on the NPL/NPE indicators); rather, it is based on the (non-risk) indicators that are published in section 4 of the EBA Guidelines on internal governance under Directive 2013/36/EU.

PARAGRAPH_73309: An NPL/NPE ratio level to be applied at individual institution level would indicate a systemic threshold above which the institutions would be subject to more prudential rules under the scope of the guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:86]
PARAGRAPH_73310: Such a threshold would not be a clear cut-off point; competent authorities would have discretionary power not to wait for institutions to reach this threshold and to apply certain (precautionary) rules when the NPL/NPE ratio of an institution was below the set threshold but showed a somewhat signalling trend. Such a threshold would be a risk-based metric and would apply to all banks.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:86]
PARAGRAPH_73311: Option 3b (not introducing a threshold) would not remove the potential problems related to NPEs and would not achieve the policy objectives, for example comparability and consistency across banks and jurisdictions. The preferred option is option 3a.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:86]
PARAGRAPH_73313: The numbers of banks with an NPL ratio below 5% (and below 10%) were calculated to take into account the potential binding effect of the threshold. If a 5% threshold were introduced, about 38% of the banks in the sample would remain above this threshold. If this threshold were introduced at a (more relaxed) 10% level, the number of banks that would remain above the critical value would fall to 19%. One limitation of this analysis is that the EBA sample includes mostly large banks, while the baseline scenario shows that problems related to NPEs/NPLs across the EU are greater among small and medium-sized banks.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:86]
PARAGRAPH_73314: Similarly, as of end September 2017, the EBA data show that 33% of banks have an NPE ratio above the hypothetical 5% level, while this figure goes down to 15% for a hypothetical threshold of 10%.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:86] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_73315: Another question is whether the threshold should be static or varying depending on other microeconomic and macroeconomic conditions. A varying threshold applicable at the industry level is not justified on microeconomic grounds (current risk profile of banks in relation to NPL/NPE ratios) or macroeconomic grounds (dynamics of macroeconomic conditions). Indeed, the average NPL/NPE ratio for all banks has been fairly stable, albeit following a decreasing trend, over recent years (see Figure 1). The objectives of the guidelines are to ensure an early warning system and to establish preventive measures against critical NPEs/NPLs. A static threshold is expected to be an effective measure in this regard, while a varying threshold accounting for the tendency of NPEs/NPLs to fluctuate during the economic cycle is not expected to achieve these objectives. In other words, the justification for a decrease in the threshold would be related to more stable (long- term) average risk performance on the part of banks and not necessarily the (short- or medium- term) economic conditions that a varying threshold would capture. The EBA guidelines introduce a static threshold (option 3a(ii)).

PARAGRAPH_73336: In relation to the 5% NPL level for the implementation of sections 4 and 5 of the guidelines, while some stakeholders commented that one standard threshold was undesirable, others commented on the calibration of the threshold. A majority of stakeholders asked for further clarification on the level of implementation. As explained below, the EBA is of the view that an easy-to-understand and easy-to-implement threshold has many benefits, in line with the objectives of these guidelines (i.e. the effective management and reduction of NPLs), but also in terms of transparency and supervisory convergence. The EBA did not change the calibration of the 5% NPL level. The EBA clarified the level of implementation and allowed supervisory discretion regarding when institutions should apply sections 4 and 5 of the guidelines on the basis of portfolio assessment.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:88]
PARAGRAPH_73337: Some stakeholders commented on the potential workload imposed by complying with the guidelines and argued that either a delay in the implementation date or a transitional period was needed. Similarly, few stakeholders asked the EBA to clarify the entry and exit criteria for the application of sections 4 and 5 of the guidelines. As explained below, the EBA amended the implementation period to 30 June 2019 with no additional transitional period. Accordingly, to clarify the entry criterion, credit institutions are expected to calculate their NPL ratios using data as of 31 December 2018 and to start implementing the guidelines from 30 June 2019. Regarding the exit criterion, the EBA clarified that this will depend on institutions' NPE strategies and should be decided as part of supervisory dialogue.

PARAGRAPH_73338: Following stakeholder comments, the EBA also clarified and stressed that credit institutions should account for consumer protection issues and have regard for fair treatment of consumers not only when they apply sections 4 and 5 of the guidelines but also when they consider forbearance measures as part of their NPE management and reduction strategies.

PARAGRAPH_73339: With regard to the section on NPE impairment measurement and write-offs, the EBA received various comments asking for clarification on the requirements. In order to avoid a potential lack of clarity or conflict between these guidelines and accounting rules, the EBA removed some of the sections and clarified the issues relating to the remaining part of the section. When addressing these comments in the feedback table below, the EBA has ensured consistency of language between the guidelines and the accounting rules.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:88]
PARAGRAPH_73340: The EBA also received several comments in relation to the EUR 300 000 set threshold for the gross carrying amount of collateral above which credit institutions are not allowed to use indexed valuation. Most stakeholders argued that there were many factors (e.g. location of the property, purchasing power, economic environment, etc.) to be considered for collateral valuation and that this threshold would not be feasible given significant differences in these factors not only across jurisdictions but also within countries. The EBA acknowledges the difficulty of introducing one single threshold and, as explained in the feedback table, has changed the requirements so that the competent authorities are expected to set thresholds in their jurisdictions.

PARAGRAPH_73398: The guidelines are addressed to both competent authorities and credit institutions, as it is for the latter to set out NPE strategies, where required, and for the former to assess these strategies as part of ongoing supervisory engagement in the SREP. Addressing the guidelines to institutions also contributes to the convergence of supervisory practices, as it ex ante spells out the requirements for the NPE strategies and governance arranges to be implemented by the affected institutions and thus reduces the risk of different treatment of similar institutions due to supervisory discretion.

The current guidelines specify, in the context of relevant provisions of the CRD, sound risk management practices for credit institutions for managing NPEs, FBEs and foreclosed assets. The guidelines also provide competent authorities with guidance on evaluating credit institutions' risk management practices, policies, processes and procedures for managing NPEs and FBEs.

Article 4(3) of the SSM Regulation provides, inter alia. that ‘the ECB shall adopt guidelines and recommendations, and take decisions subject to and in compliance with the relevant Union law and in particular any legislative and non-legislative act, including those referred to in Articles 290 and 291 TFEU. It shall in particular be subject to binding regulatory and implementing technical standards developed by EBA and adopted by the Commission in accordance with Article 10 to 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, to Article 16 of that Regulation, and to the provisions of that Regulation on the European supervisory handbook developed by EBA in accordance with that Regulation.' Article 16(3) of the EBA Regulation provides that 'the competent authorities and financial institutions shall make every effort to comply with those guidelines and recommendations. Within 2 months of the issuance of a guideline or recommendation, each competent authority shall confirm whether it complies or intends to comply with that guideline or recommendation. In the event that a competent authority does not comply or does not intend to comply, it shall inform the EBA, stating its reasons. The EBA shall publish the fact that a competent

Thus, in the case that the ECB complies with the EBA guidelines, it is expected that the ECB guidance will be in line with the EBA guidelines. Financial institutions will then be expected to comply with the EBA guidelines also having regard to the ECB guidance, which should be considered to set out the supervisory practice on the basis of which the ECB complies with the EBA guidelines. More generally, where a competent authority declares compliance with EBA guidelines, financial institutions to which those guidelines are addressed are expected to comply with the guidelines, both on the basis of the soft or hard legal instrument by which the EBA guidelines have been 'internalised' within the pertinent supervisory practice of the competent authority and on the basis of their directly applicable obligation referred to in Article 16 of the EBA Regulation, i.e. the obligation on the financial institutions to make every effort to comply with EBA guidelines. Where a competent authority has declared that it will not comply with EBA guidelines, there is a tension between the aforementioned directly applicable Union obligation on the relevant financial institutions to make every effort to comply with EBA guidelines and the fact that their competent authority has explained that it cannot comply. This tension can be settled only on an ad hoc basis, primarily having

Where the ECB Guidance or any supervisory practice of a competent authority for that matter provides for additional elements, provisions or conditions, which do not contradict the EBA Guidelines, in areas where the EBA Guidelines remain silent or can be further specified by competent authorities, financial institutions should also separately consider those additional elements, provisions or conditions.

PARAGRAPH_73468: Some stakeholders commented on the treatment of purchased NPLs. They stated that there are credit institutions that act as investors in NPL secondary markets and that the current requirements of the draft guidelines might have unintended consequences, i.e. they could discourage credit institutions from investing in NPL secondary markets, which would also contradict the EBA's initiatives promoting secondary markets for NPLS. The stakeholders therefore invited the EBA to consider the exclusion of purchased NPLs from both the scope of application and the definition of the NPL ratio for the purposes of these guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:96]
PARAGRAPH_73469: The EBA does not agree with excluding purchased NPLs outright from the calculation of the NPL ratio and from the scope of these guidelines, as any purchased NPL will contribute to the stock of existing NPLs and associated activities, including workout, servicing, monitoring, etc. Furthermore, exclusion of purchased NPLs from the calculation of the NPL ratio could create a secondary definition departing from the harmonised standards of the industry. The EBA agrees, however, that there may be specialised credit institutions whose sole activity is purchasing and servicing of NPEs. Therefore, in

It does not consider varying levels of NPL ratios over time, from one institution to another, depending on the arbitration between profitability and cost of risk, from one type of credit to another (consumer credit, mortgage credit, etc.), and also throughout business cycles, and therefore may have a negative impact on efforts to implement an anti-cyclical economic policy in the EU.

PARAGRAPH_73520: Similarly to points 3 and 5 above, stakeholders commented that some type of activities, such as loan restructuring, consumer finance and social housing, have by definition high rates of gross NPLs without necessarily bearing high losses. In some cases, gross NPL can be 5% but, taking into account other factors, that may indicate that the actual losses experienced are low.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:98]
PARAGRAPH_73521: In addition, the application of a gross NPL ratio to such portfolios could be counterintuitive: since the expected loss is low, margins are also relatively low, and operating an NPL portfolio in accordance with the principles described would put additional pressure on the operational margins of institutions.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:99]
PARAGRAPH_73531: Some stakeholders commented that the 5% NPL threshold should be indicative. It should not be an automatic trigger for the implementation of sections 4 and 5 but trigger supervisory dialogue between the competent authority and the institution. Supervisory dialogue remains essential and credit institutions should have the opportunity to provide explanations to competent authorities as regards their having an elevated level of NPLS. The EBA's position: for the purposes of these guidelines, the EBA supports the introduction of a simple-to- understand static threshold at a level of 5% gross NPL ratio for the application of sections 4 and 5. This will ensure consistency and clarity for credit institutions in the application of the guidelines, and convergence of supervisory practices. This is an important and effective harmonised strategy to achieve NPL reductions in line with the Council's Action Plan. This threshold does not aim to set internal limits for credit institutions; rather, it sets a prudential framework for stricter supervisory monitoring for timely prevention of the emergence of NPLs at higher levels. The central objective of the guidelines is to reduce the levels of NPEs/NPLs, rather than only to promote prudent provisioning. As a result, the EBA is of the view that the gross NPL ratio meets the objective and is a more accurate and fit-for-purpose indicator than the net NPL ratio, which would focus more on potential additional losses rather than the overall magnitude of the NPE issue. Furthermore, the EBA believes that the threshold would need to be lower if the net NPL ratio were introduced. The net NPL ratio is an important indicator and should be part of the SREP assessment together with other risk indicators, for example CET1. For the purposes of transparency and simplicity in the application of these guidelines, the threshold is introduced as a static value calibrated with the NPL ratios observed in 2016-2017; a detailed analysis of the calibration is provided in the impact assessment. Any recalibration of the threshold in the light of the

PARAGRAPH_73539: feedback received was not deemed necessary, as this would conflict with the policy objectives of the guidelines. In terms of the level of application, the EBA has clarified in the guidelines that the threshold will be applicable at consolidated, sub-consolidated and solo levels and will require the application of sections 4 and 5 where NPL ratios at any of these levels is equal to or greater than 5%. For example, where a credit institution has an NPL ratio below 5% at consolidated level but a subsidiary of this institution has an NPL ratio above 5%, according to the guidelines, the subsidiary in question should follow the provisions of sections 4 and 5. Furthermore, the EBA clarifies that the guidelines do not set any NPL threshold at portfolio level and leave it to competent authorities' discretion to apply the requirements based on banks' portfolios. Competent authorities are expected to assess the materiality of a given portfolio (e.g. the nature and size of the portfolio in terms of total exposures) and of the NPEs, including their number, size and concentration, associated with that portfolio. It is then up to competent authorities to decide, following the materiality assessment, whether affected credit institutions are subject to the provisions of sections 4 and 5 of the guidelines at portfolio level.

PARAGRAPH_73590: The draft guidelines state that 'the NPE strategy and the operational plan should be defined and approved by the management body and reviewed at least annually.' Two stakeholders commented that it would be unreasonable to consider that this always implied the bank's management board. The management board of an internationally active bank is not the appropriate body to approve lower-level policy documents; policies are better delegated, understood and monitored by lower-level policy committees that are closer to the details. Therefore, the stakeholder stated, the definition of the 'management body' is unclear and the EBA should clarify expectations around the definition of 'management body', adopting a proportionate approach, especially for internationally active banks.

PARAGRAPH_73606: Two stakeholders invited the EBA to differentiate between NPEs based on past due and those based on unlikeliness to pay. Stakeholders argued that some of the criteria for the unlikely to pay NPEs may not be sustained from a contractual, legal or judicial execution point of view, which could constitute an effective impediment to NPE reduction.

Given the definition of NPEs in accordance with Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, the EBA does not consider differentiation of the treatment of NPEs and of NPE strategies on the basis of the past due criterion and the unlikeliness to pay criterion necessary.

As part of an active portfolio reduction strategy, banks have come up with this strategy by which significant risk is transferred (usually from 51% to 80%) while allocating the business management to specialised professional partners. Thus, banks have been able to enter into larger transactions, at the expense of a lower price but retaining potential upside.

The respondent also wished to make two additional comments on sections 4 and 5. It believed that, most importantly, NPE strategies should be developed, approved and monitored at the right level to be meaningful. While the guidelines refer to the 'overall' or 'overarching' NPE strategy, industry practices are more likely to take the form of adopting strategies that are tailored to each top non-performing obligor based on the relevant context. As mentioned above, the jurisdiction in which the NPE strategy will be implemented is critical in determining which options are available and most effective. Similarly, it is unlikely that the analytical steps listed under sections 4.1 and 4.2 to develop the NPE strategy and assess the operating environment would lead to a one size fits all strategy. The respondent argued that the guidelines should explicitly recognise this reality to avoid unintended consequences.

PARAGRAPH_73640: this regard, it was concerned about the assumption expressed in paragraph 15, in the 'Objective and structure of the guidelines' section, that the size and complexity of an institution were primary indicators for setting supervisory expectations on 'organisational aspects of management of NPEs and FBEs'. According to the stakeholder, it should be made clearer that the additional guidance in the guidelines is primarily targeted at institutions for which asset quality, the adequacy of the existing governance and the NPE strategy are not deemed satisfactory, regardless of size and complexity. In other words, alignment with those guidelines should not disproportionately impact large and complex institutions if key stakeholders are satisfied with their current NPL levels and management of non-performing and forborne exposures.

Furthermore, the guidelines aim to apply the requirements in a proportionate manner. They aim to avoid any unnecessary burdens on the basis of institutions' size and complexity. In other words, whenever possible, the guidelines apply simplified requirements when a small and less complex institution has a high NPL ratio and hence is subject to sections 4 and 5 of the guidelines, for example regarding the requirements for the WUs.

This would unnecessarily slow down the workout process and result in additional costs.

Similarly, one stakeholder commented that NPE WU set-ups varied significantly between institutions, and that, in many cases, the three lines of defence framework described in section 5.3 might not necessarily be embedded into the organisational structure. The assessment of the adequacy of the control framework should focus on the independence of the control functions rather than on the organisational structure. Independence of controls is often achieved through oversight by governance committees.

The stakeholder commented that, from a systemic risk perspective, credit institutions should decide themselves the most appropriate organisation and then, if needed, competent authorities should evaluate the organisational arrangements and apply pressure to ensure that they fulfil the regulatory requirements. Consequently, the stakeholder requested that the EBA consider an alternative regulatory choice in section 2 of the guidelines ('Subject matter, scope and definitions'), allowing credit institutions to decide the best organisation to manage NPL

PARAGRAPH_73738: One stakeholder commented that care should be taken in the wording of Section 5.4.3, paragraph 107, as the concept of 'avoidance of foreclosure' is not generally included in the language of risk participation/credit risk hedging transactions, and this requirement in the guidelines might introduce unwanted accounting implications. The stakeholder recommends clarifying that minimising expected losses is the overriding principle in this article and that 'avoidance of foreclosure' is relevant only insofar as it is legally required (in the case of consumer protection rules, for example) or as a secondary consideration to minimisation of expected losses.

PARAGRAPH_73742: Some issues that may be encountered when operationalising and monitoring the NPE strategy are outlined below: . Different authorities may have different views on what constitutes an 'ambitious but realistic target'; this may result in credit institutions being held to different standards across jurisdictions. . The guidelines allow for an annual review of targets by credit institutions. In order to avoid significant reductions of the targets, it may be worth including some guidance on what revisions are acceptable.

PARAGRAPH_73752: · The guidelines may also benefit from additional detail on how compliance with the set target is to be monitored and enforced. For example, if increases in loan portfolios exceed forecasts but reductions in NPEs fall short, is this considered compliant? To ensure that the credit institution is indeed tackling existing NPL stock in an active manner, at a national level the competent authority could use a static denominator when calculating the NPL ratio for the purpose of monitoring the implementation of the plan. . Some issues may also arise in terms of the duration of legal proceedings. In certain jurisdictions, the duration of legal proceedings may well exceed the three-year medium-term horizon outlined in the guidelines. Would these NPEs be considered 'resolved' for the purpose of monitoring the reduction of NPEs, even though the final outcome would still be pending?

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:114] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_73769: The draft guidelines state that 'The contractual terms for any forbearance measure should ensure that the credit institution has the right to review the agreed forbearance measures if the situation of the borrower improves and more favourable conditions for the credit institution (ranging from the forbearance to the original contractual conditions) could therefore be enforced. Credit institutions should also consider including strict consequences, like a requirement for additional collateral, in the contractual terms for borrowers who fail to comply with the forbearance agreement.' Some stakeholders commented that this provision might not be compatible with national legislation. For example, in Spain banks cannot ask for additional guarantees, while in Italy the concession of an 'additional security' as a standalone measure is subject to some legal constraints. Therefore, this measure can be implemented only in combination with other FBE measures.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:114] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_73770: The legal effect of the paragraph in question is that credit institutions should consider whether they should include in forbearance agreements strict consequences for borrowers who fail to comply with those agreements; one such strict consequence could be to require additional collateral. The EBA is of the view that, with that content, this provision cannot actually conflict with any national law applicable. This is because the guidance provided is that credit institutions 'should consider including' rather than 'should include' strict consequences, while the 'requirement for additional collateral' is one possibility. In considering such measures, credit institutions naturally have to take into account not only the business specificities of each case but also the legal regime applicable. If strict(er) consequences are already provided for by law (e.g. if the law requires that execution should be initiated), then these might be seen as an appropriately strict consequences that could be included in the agreement by means of cross- reference to the (national) law applicable. Conversely, if strict consequences (included asking for additional collateral) are excluded due to the legal

PARAGRAPH_73781: Some stakeholders commented that, according to section 6 on forbearance, before granting any forbearance measures, banks should assess the borrower's creditworthiness or in general the borrower's ability to pay in the future (at the end of the forbearance measures). In some countries (e.g. Italy), laws issued by government or agreements signed with associations of consumers or enterprises provide for mandatory forbearance measures (e.g. a moratorium on payment of instalments) by banks in the case of specific events regarding the borrower (e.g. loss of job, death, earthquake). In the case of a law, regulation or institutional agreement whereby forbearance measures are mandatory, banks should be exempt from the requirements of section 6.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:115] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_73782: In Section 6, the EBA guidelines recommend that credit institutions 'assess the borrower's repayment capacity' before granting any forbearance measures. To conflict with that particular piece of guidance, a national law would need to prohibit the institution from assessing the borrower's repayment capacity before forbearance. That is unlikely, but, in any case, the guidelines would be subject to any hard law provision, provided that that provision was not seen as violating mandatory EU law. In section 6, it is recommended that forbearance measures are granted when the borrower meets certain criteria. This should not be seen as precluding institutions from granting forbearance on the basis of hard law provisions of EU or EU-compatible national law.

Section 6.2.2 describes the risk that an impairment may be masked, but, again, this does not reflect how a non-portfolio exposure would be managed. Furthermore, it is not clear to the respondent that portfolio-level metrics on forbearance would be at all helpful where exposures are considered individually. The respondent notes that section 6.2.4 recognises that there are differences between homogeneous borrowers and more complex ones, but this is not reflected throughout the guidance.

PARAGRAPH_73860: One stakeholder commented that the draft guidelines required credit institutions to systematically collect documented financial information from customers in order to justify the measures undertaken. For consumer credit activity (low duration, small amounts, exclusively individuals), for instance, such requirements are disproportionate. They are likely to complicate and hinder forbearance processes. Although forbearance processes are favourable for customers and carried out at their request, these excess requirements could result in the exclusion of some customers from these processes.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:121]
PARAGRAPH_73905: In addition, one stakeholder added that there were circumstances in which the timing of write-offs is subject to events outside the control of banks. The stakeholder suggested that the guidelines should acknowledge those situations and include additional flexibility in the language accordingly.

PARAGRAPH_73917: One stakeholder requested further clarification on paragraph 182, which reads in part: 'A write-off should not be considered as the credit institution forfeiting the legal right to recover the debt'. The stakeholder expressed concerns, stating that this statement was either factually incorrect or misleading. Some jurisdictions treat partial or full write-off of an exposure as a decision to forfeit the legal claim on the debt, or debt forgiveness.

PARAGRAPH_73921: Paragraphs 185(a) and (c) refer to write-offs when an exposure is deemed unrecoverable or there is reasonable financial evidence that the borrower is unable to repay the full amount. This terminology differs from the criterion under IFRS 9 (i.e. no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flow on a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof).

PARAGRAPH_73938: Most stakeholders criticised both the level and the frequency of assessment of the property-specific valuation threshold of EUR 300 000. The stakeholders argued that:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:123]
PARAGRAPH_73939: 1. The threshold is very conservative and would result in excessive costs, since it would increase fixed NPL management costs without modifying recovery capacity, especially for the leasing industry.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:123]
PARAGRAPH_73940: 2. The threshold does not account for the diversity of the European property markets and in particular the location of the property. The threshold is too low and in particular for large cities.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:123]
PARAGRAPH_73941: 3. The threshold does not account for foreign exchange rate changes for non-euro-denominated properties (although this could be easily mitigated by adding 'or equivalent' to the text of the guidelines).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:123]
PARAGRAPH_73942: 4. It is neither feasible nor necessary to complete physical valuations of all NPE properties; given the volume, even introducing a threshold of EUR 300 000 would result in significant volumes of physical valuations.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:123]
PARAGRAPH_73943: 5. The proposed frequency of the valuation is high.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:123]
PARAGRAPH_73944: 6. The additional cost of more frequent and physical valuations would increase the cost of managing NPEs and the cost to the customer, which could lead to an unnecessary erosion of equity. 7. Regarding the frequency of valuation of non-residential immovable property, one year is considered too infrequent, given that the sale process can take longer than this. It is recommended that only in the event of a sale not being in progress (i.e. no offer one year after repossession) would a further annual assessment be made (it is worth noting also that, while it is unlikely that, following repossession of a residential property, a sale would not be complete within three years, the 'sale in progress' exclusion would also be recommended in this situation).

PARAGRAPH_73952: Scope of the threshold and valuation

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:124]
PARAGRAPH_73953: Many FBEs are only in short-term financial difficulty, so some stakeholders consider it unnecessary to include these in a physical evaluation. For long-term FBEs, it is argued that there is in general strong rehabilitation performance, and that therefore imposing a requirement for physical valuation of these collaterals may not be necessary.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:124]
PARAGRAPH_73954: In order to manage these potential issues, physical valuations should be limited to collateral that is in repossession only, as these exposures are more likely be the result of no contact with a customer and/or their inability to engage in a repayment plan.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:124]
PARAGRAPH_73955: The EBA's position: the EBA acknowledges the variations in property values across jurisdictions and among different geographical areas (e.g. cities) in a jurisdiction. The EBA also understands there are several parameters reflecting local characteristics that the valuation should account for.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:124]
PARAGRAPH_73956: It is also true that valuation for collateralised NPLs should be accurate and reflect local realities.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:124]
PARAGRAPH_73957: The EBA is, however, of the view that there should be a strong distinction in these guidelines between situations in which index valuation should be used and those in which expert appraisals are required. The EBA is of the view that this distinction can be achieved by allowing competent authorities to define thresholds in their own jurisdictions.

PARAGRAPH_73991: One respondent understands the term 'appraiser' in paragraph 201 to refer to an individual valuer within a valuation firm rather than the valuation firm itself, which may have one or many valuers. It believes that the valuer rotation proposed in paragraph 201 is too prescriptive. In many cases, there is merit in maintaining the valuer, as they have historic details and local knowledge, enabling them to assess any deterioration in condition. Furthermore, there may also be cost implications for the customer. The competitive impact of this amendment on smaller valuation firms should also be considered, as banks would probably move their business to larger multi- valuer firms to meet these valuation/revaluation requirements. Therefore, a uniform rule on this is not considered appropriate and lenders should be free to make judgements in this area, linked to the specifics of the customer situation, the level of risk, and the required expertise of the valuer.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:126]
PARAGRAPH_73992: The EBA confirms that the reference to 'appraiser' is a reference to a qualified individual professional. Rotation of experts, such as appraisers or external auditors, is a good risk management practice to ensure the accuracy and independence of valuations and reduce the risk of fraud or collusion.

PARAGRAPH_73999: Paragraph 224: it is common practice in Germany to value single and two-family homes using the 'Sachwertverfahren', which is a specifically German form of modified cost approach. To confuse matters, the discounted replacement cost approach is often mistranslated into German as Sachwertverfahren, although there are methodological differences between the two approaches. This requirement could result in the non-recognition of all valuations of single- and two- family homes using the Sachwertverfahren, which

As an alternative, the requirement could be expanded to specify that an exclusively cost-based approach within a valuation methodology will not be accepted. The Sachwertverfahren combines the cost and market approaches by including the land value - generally derived from comparative values - and applying a market adjustment if necessary.

Traditionally, this property value procedure for owner-occupied properties such as condominiums is also used for one- and two-family houses. A value determined by the Sachwertverfahren is calculated as follows: 1) the land value ('Bodenwert'): the land value is determined by a comparison value method.

The outdoor facilities must also be taken into account if they are of particular importance. 3) Depreciation: other factors influencing value (e.g. economic ageing or above-average state of preservation) must also be taken into account. 4) Finally, a haircut of at least 10% on the calculated value is subtracted.

PARAGRAPH_74044: One stakeholder noted that section 9, 'Collateral valuation of immovable and movable property', is fully dedicated to non-performing and forborne exposures. Nevertheless, with respect to immovable properties the section's proposed wording leaves room for interpretation regarding whether or not the proposed requirements will impact all exposures (both in collateralised and non- collateralised formats), not just non-performing and forborne exposures. Therefore, the stakeholder sought further clarification within the section. As part of this further clarification, it would be important to make clear that the proposed threshold (Question 9) applies only to non- performing and forborne exposures.

PARAGRAPH_74058: externally. The stakeholder believes that external specialist appraisers are best placed to provide an accurate and reliable valuation, and that it is unclear on what basis institutions would be expected to challenge those experts. The value of residential or commercial buildings is often driven by very local attributes, which local valuation experts, rather than international banks, are best placed to assess. Similarly, the value of very specific types of collateral (e.g. oil fields, coal mines) would be best appraised by appropriate experts external to the institutions. It would be disproportionate to expect institutions to house this level of expertise simply to be able to challenge external valuations on an ad hoc/infrequent basis. Seeking additional external valuations as benchmarks would be costly and in some cases not an available option.
