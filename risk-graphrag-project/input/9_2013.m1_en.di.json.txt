[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:FIVA_MOK] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:9]
PARAGRAPH_32578: (8) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, the requirement of equivalent treatment in chapter 11, section 7 of the SMA requires that a takeover bid is made to all holders of securities in an offeree company who own the class of securities targeted in the takeover bid. However, a bid may also target only a specific class of securities.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:FIVA_MOK] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:9]
PARAGRAPH_32579: (9) Where a bid targets all shares subject to public trading in a regulated market, FIN-FSA recommends that it is also extended to shares which are subscribed for before the closing of the offer period or are received on the basis of securities issued by the offeree company carrying entitlement to shares issued by it.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:FIVA_MOK] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:9] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_32580: (10) The requirement of equivalent treatment also requires, according to FIN-FSA's interpretation, that the terms of the takeover bid are consistent. A restricted or conditional bid in itself does not put holders of securities in a nonequivalent position. Therefore, a bid may concern, for example, only a given proportion of securities held by the holders of securities, if the restriction is the same for all holders of securities. For example, if in a partial takeover bid, acceptances cover a larger amount of securities than the offeror has undertaken to purchase, acceptances shall be made as a rule so that the same relative proportion of securities is purchased from all holders of securities.

PARAGRAPH_32586: (11) In assessing the implementation of equivalent treatment, according to FIN-FSA's interpretation, any agreements and arrangements between the offeror and holders of securities targeted by the bid are also taken into account, where they are connected with the takeover bid. Therefore, an offeror may not agree, for example, on any specific benefits to be extended to certain shareholders in share transactions preceding the takeover bid, where such benefits lead to effectively better consideration for these shareholders than that which is offered in the takeover bid.

If the offeror has particular grounds to assume that the proposed arrangement will not be supported by a sufficient number of shareholders in a General Meeting, before the publication of the takeover bid - bearing in mind the provisions on the use of inside information - the offeror should also consider the position held by such shareholders whose consent is de facto needed to make decisions in a General Meeting of shareholders, regarding the anticipated takeover bid.

In order that the takeover bid does not disrupt the functioning of the offeree company for an unreasonably long period or disrupt the price formation of the securities of the offeree company, FIN-FSA recommends that the bid procedure is commenced within a reasonable period of the publication of the takeover bid.

PARAGRAPH_32753: (31) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, a specific reason to extend the offer period beyond ten weeks could be, for example, that there are particular hindrances to the implementation of the bid. If, for example, the implementation of the bid requires the permission of a competition authority, the offeror shall extend the offer period until the authority has processed the matter and the offeror has had the possibility to assess the impact of the conditions, if any, included in the permission of the competition authority, on the bid.

In particular, this practice may improve retail investors' opportunities to react to the situation.

Correspondingly, a decision on extension of the offer period may be appropriate when it is justifiable to convene a General Meeting of the shareholders during the offer period due to issues arising during the offer period. Such issues may include, for example, a competing bid or a bid on an individual business function of the offeree company.

In situations where the shareholders of the offeree company have required a convening of a General Meeting of the shareholders, FIN-FSA pays particular attention in its deliberations on the matters to be decided on by the General Meeting.

PARAGRAPH_32787: FIN-FSA recommends that the conditions set for the implementation of the takeover bid are unambiguous enough, such that the holders of the securities for which the bid is made could themselves assess the probability of their fulfilment. The fulfilment of the conditions should also be clearly verifiable, in order that the implementation of the bid would not in effect remain at the absolute discretion of the offeror. The conditions of the bid should also be reasonable so that the rights and obligations of the offeror as a whole would be balanced relative to the rights and obligations of the holders of the securities for which the bid is made.

PARAGRAPH_32816: According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, a competing bid is only a takeover bid if disclosed in accordance with chapter 11, section 9 of the SMA.

PARAGRAPH_32817: (53) Pursuant to chapter 11, section 17 of the SMA, the publication of a competing bid triggers the obligation to supplement the offer document of the first bid. The right provided to FIN- FSA in chapter 11, section 11, subsection 4 of the SMA to require the offer period of the first bid to be extended by a maximum of ten banking days is generally necessary in the context of competing bids, so that the holders of securities in the offeree company who have accepted the first bid have sufficient time to consider the cancellation of their acceptance and the Board of Directors of the offeree company has time to supplement their statement on the first bid. Therefore, FIN-FSA will, as a rule, require extension of the offer period of the first bid so that it remains valid for at least ten banking days after the publication of the supplementation of the offer document.

PARAGRAPH_32866: (5) Pursuant to chapter 11, section 19 of the SMA, the obligation to launch a bid concerns all shares of the offeree company, regardless of whether the share is subject to trading on a regulated market or not. In addition to the shares of the offeree company, the obligation to launch a bid concerns all securities issued by the offeree company carrying entitlement to its shares referred to in chapter 2, section 1 of the SMA. These include, for example, subscription rights, convertible bonds, option rights and other special rights to shares. Other securities issued by the offeree company which can be exchanged for or converted to shares of the offeree company, according to their terms of issue, belong in the scope of the obligation to launch a bid. According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, such securities referred to in chapter 2, section 1 of the SMA, also include securities subject to a temporary restriction on transfer.

As a rule, the obligation to launch a bid arises separately after exceeding the 30 and 50 per cent thresholds. According to FIN- FSA's interpretation, in other situations than those referred to in chapter 11, section 21, subsection 5 of the SMA, the obligation to launch a bid remains, even if the shareholder's proportion, after exceeding the bid threshold, falls below it.

PARAGRAPH_32878: (8) In this case, according to FIN-FSA's interpretation, avoidance of the obligation to launch a bid requires that a voluntary takeover bid has also been made for such option rights carrying entitlement to shares whose strike price exceeds the consideration offered for the shares. The consideration for such option rights is subject to the provisions in chapter 7.3 of these regulations and guidelines on the consideration in a mandatory takeover bid for such option rights.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:FIVA_MOK] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:27]
PARAGRAPH_32879: (9) Correspondingly, pursuant to chapter 11, section 21, subsection 1 of the SMA, the obligation to launch a bid does not arise again in a situation where a mandatory takeover bid has been launched as a consequence of exceeding the 30 per cent threshold, and the 50 per cent threshold is exceeded through a mandatory takeover bid, or otherwise during the offer period. However, the obligation to launch a bid arises pursuant to chapter 11, section 19 of the SMA, where the proportion of the offeror, as a result of a voluntary or mandatory takeover bid, remains below 50 per cent of the voting rights in the offeree company, and the offeror subsequently acquires shares so that the 50 per cent threshold is exceeded. The obligation to launch a bid also arises when a voluntary takeover bid is made, for example, only for shares issued by the offeree company but not for securities issued by the offeree company carrying entitlement to its shares.

PARAGRAPH_32880: (10) Although the voting rights belonging to the same sphere of control are calculated on the proportion of voting rights resulting in an obligation to launch a bid, according to FIN-FSA's interpretation, the obligation to launch a bid is assessed at the level of the owner. Therefore, an obligation to launch a bid arises generally in a situation where the voting rights of shareholders acting in concert are transferred entirely to a single shareholder or in situations where shares are transferred to another company belonging to the same group.

PARAGRAPH_32881: (11) Similarly, according to FIN-FSA's interpretation, an obligation to launch a bid generally arises when the control, referred to in chapter 2, section 4 of the SMA, shifts within an entity whose voting rights in a company subject to public trading exceeds the threshold for obligation to launch a bid.

According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, indirect holdings are not calculated on the basis of the relative proportion of holdings or voting rights of the shareholder, but they are accounted for in full in calculating the proportion of voting rights. According to FIN- FSA's interpretation, shares referred to in chapter 11, section 20, subsection 1, paragraph 4 of the SMA, do not include shares with which an agent of the shareholder participates in a General Meeting of the shareholder, if he only votes according to instructions provided by the shareholder.

PARAGRAPH_32918: a) The proportion of voting rights exceeding the threshold for an obligation to launch a bid is not effectively transferred, for example, when transferring holdings to an entity or foundation within the same sphere of control.

PARAGRAPH_32924: (21) Unless the position of minority shareholders has been secured sufficiently by way of other measures, an exemption from the obligation to launch a bid under section 20, subsections d-f above is contingent upon a decision on the arrangement by a General Meeting of the shareholders of the offeree company. In this case, the offeree company must disclose sufficient information on the anticipated arrangement before the General Meeting of the shareholders. In the General Meeting of the shareholders deciding on the arrangement, shareholders of the offeree company, who are independent of the arrangement, must support the arrangement by a majority of at least two thirds of the votes cast.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:FIVA_MOK] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29]
PARAGRAPH_32925: (22) A particular reason for an exemption from the obligation to launch a bid may also be that the mandatory bid threshold is exceeded in a situation where mutually independent shareholders begin to act in concert in order to exercise control in the offeree company. In this situation, FIN-FSA pays special attention, in its consideration, to granting an exemption on the mutual independence of the shareholders acting in concert and to considering whether the shareholders acting in concert had increased their proportion of voting rights before they began to act in concert.

PARAGRAPH_32956: (2) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, the requirement of equivalent treatment in chapter 11, section 7 of the SMA, means that the consideration for each class of securities must be in reasonable and equitable proportion, relative to the rights produced by each class of securities.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:FIVA_MOK] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:31]
PARAGRAPH_32957: (3) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, where the securities of different classes in the offeree company are subject to trading on regulated markets, a basis for determining a reasonable and equitable proportion can be sought by reference to their market prices. In this case, the premium paid for different classes of securities should generally be proportionately the same. However, the assessment should also account for the liquidity of the different classes of securities. If, for example, trading on listed option rights has been limited, it is usually more reasonable to use the consideration payable for the share as the starting point for determining a reasonable and equitable proportion, than the relative premium payable for the share.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:FIVA_MOK] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:31]
PARAGRAPH_32958: (4) When securities not subject to public trading are concerned, the assessment of considerations paid for different securities should, according to FIN-FSA's interpretation, account for the rights produced by the different securities. Where the rights are similar, offering the same consideration is warranted. In determining the consideration payable for non-listed option rights, reference could be made to pricing models generally applied in the pricing of options.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:FIVA_MOK] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:31]
PARAGRAPH_32959: (5) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, in assessing the implementation of equivalent treatment, attention is also paid to any consideration payable for such rights carrying entitlement to shares in the offeree company which are not securities referred to in chapter 2, section 1 of the SMA.

Hence, according to FIN-FSA's interpretation in a share transaction immediately preceding a voluntary or mandatory takeover bid, it is possible, for example, to offer a different class of consideration than that offered in the takeover bid, if the share transaction as a whole can be regarded as a separate transaction from the takeover bid. The overall assessment shall take into account the purpose of the share transaction and also other terms than those linked directly to the quality and amount of the consideration.

However, the consideration must be in a reasonable and equitable proportion to other securities subject to the takeover bid. Where the payment of a cash consideration, for example due to the shortness of the subscription period remaining or a considerable difference between the consideration payable for the share and the strike price, would lead to an unreasonable outcome from the viewpoint of the holders of other securities or the offeror, it is possible to derogate from the obligation to pay a cash consideration.

PARAGRAPH_33056: (26) FIN-FSA's interpretations presented in chapter 7.5 on the valuation principles of a securities-based consideration are primarily applicable to situations where a security given as consideration is subject to trading in a regulated market supervised by an authority.

PARAGRAPH_33057: (27) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, continuous fluctuation of the value of the consideration is an integral part of the nature of a securities-based consideration. Functioning corporate acquisition market require that the offeror can, already in launching a voluntary takeover bid, assess the costs incurring from an acquisition with considerable certainty. In addition, the reliable price formation of the securities of the offeree company requires that the parties have a clear conception of how an acquisition of securities beyond the scope of the takeover bid will affect the consideration offered or to be offered in the takeover bid.
