PARAGRAPH_79567: 1. Executive summary

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_79568: De-risking refers to decisions made by credit and financial institutions to refuse to enter into, or to terminate, business relationships with individual customers or categories of customers associated with higher money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risk.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_79569: In January 2022, the EBA published an Opinion on the scale and impact of de-risking in the EU.1 This Opinion identified the main drivers of de-risking and the negative impact unwarranted de-risking can have on customers and access to financial services and the fight against financial crime. It also high- lighted the steps competent authorities and co-legislators should take to address unwarranted de- risking and mitigate its negative impact.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_79570: The European Commission welcomed the EBA's Opinion and asked the EBA to issue guidelines on the steps institutions should take to facilitate access to financial services by those categories of customers that the EBA's analysis had highlighted as particularly vulnerable to unwarranted de-risking.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_79571: In response to this request, the EBA issued Guidelines on policies and controls for the effective man- agement of ML/TF risks when providing access to financial services. The guidelines complement the EBA's separate Guidelines on ML/TF risk factors by specifying further the policies, procedures and con- trols credit and financial institutions should have in place to mitigate and effectively manage ML/TF risks in accordance with Article 8(3) of Directive (EU) 2015/849, including in situations where the pro- visions in Article 16 of Directive (EU) 2014/92 apply, which introduces the right of individuals to open and maintain a payment account with basic features.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_79572: Through these guidelines, the EBA fosters a common understanding by institutions and AML/CFT su- pervisors of effective ML/TF risk management practices in situations where access by customers to financial products and services should be ensured.

PARAGRAPH_79580: 2.1 Background

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_79581: In January 2022, the EBA published an Opinion on de-risking.2 It assessed the scale of de-risking in the EU and the impact of credit and financial institutions' decisions to refuse to enter into or to terminate business relationships with individual customers or categories of customers associated with higher money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risk. The EBA found that across the EU, de-risking affected a variety of customers or potential customers of institutions. The EBA made clear that de- risking of entire categories of customers, without due consideration of individual customers' risk pro- files, may be unwarranted and a sign of ineffective ML/TF risk management.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_79582: The publication of the EBA Opinion on de-risking led the European Commission to ask the EBA to issue new guidelines on the steps institutions should take to facilitate access to financial services by those categories of customers that the EBA's analysis had highlighted as particularly vulnerable to unwar- ranted de-risking.3 This coincided with the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, which further demonstrated the adverse impact of de-risking on vulnerable customers, such as asylum seekers.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_79583: To respond to the Commission's request, the EBA prepared draft guidelines that foster a common un- derstanding by institutions and AML/CFT supervisory authorities of effective ML/TF risk management practices in situations where access by customers to financial products and services is at risk.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_79584: These guidelines complement the EBA's Guidelines on ML/TF risk factors (EBA/GL/2021/02) and spec- ify further the policies, procedures and controls credit and financial institutions should have in place to mitigate and effectively manage ML/TF risks in accordance with Article 8(3) of Directive (EU) 2015/849, including in situations where the provisions in Article 16 of Directive (EU) 2014/92 (the Pay- ment Accounts Directive - PAD) apply.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_79585: The EBA consulted the public on a version of these guidelines between 6 December 2022 and 6 Febru- ary 2023. It received 25 responses, which came from various categories of stakeholders: representa- tives of credit and financial institutions, of the diamond industry and of the not-for-profit sector, as well as individuals.

PARAGRAPH_79586: 2.2 Rationale

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_79587: Access to financial products and services is a prerequisite for participation in modern economic and social life. For the most vulnerable, preventing such access can lead to severe economic outcomes,

PARAGRAPH_79593: affect everyday life and in some cases increase the risks of being exploited. At the same time, it is important that financial crime risks are effectively managed. Through these guidelines, the EBA clari- fies the interplay between access to financial services and institutions' AML/CFT obligations. It also sets out the steps institutions should take when considering whether to refuse or terminate a business relationship with a customer based on ML/TF risk or AML/CFT compliance grounds.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_79594: The guidelines also make clear that credit and financial institutions should document any decisions to refuse a business relationship or to apply risk-mitigating measures. These decisions must be propor- tionate and aligned with the principle of non-discrimination as enshrined in Article 15 of the PAD and Article 21 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and must be made readily available to competent authorities.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_79595: The guidelines finally include aspects related to complaint mechanism institutions should have in place to ensure customers can complain if they feel they have been treated unfairly. The Joint Guidelines on complaints-handling for the securities and banking sectors4 also provide useful information on this as- pect.

To comply with their obligations under Article 14(4) of Directive (EU) 2015/849, credit and financial institutions should set out in their policies and procedures the criteria they will use to determine on which grounds they will decide that a business relationship may be rejected or terminated or that a transaction may be denied. As part of this, they should set out in their policies, procedures and controls all options for mitigating higher ML/TF risks that they will consider applying before

PARAGRAPH_79665: 15. In relation to the right of access to a payment account with basic features in accordance with Articles 16(2) and 17 of Directive 2014/92/EU, credit institutions obliged to offer such basic accounts should set out in their account opening policies and procedures how they can adjust their customer due diligence requirements to account for the fact that the limited functionali- ties of a basic payment account help mitigate the risk that the customer could abuse these products and services for financial crime purposes.

PARAGRAPH_79666: 16. When ensuring non-discriminatory access to a basic payment account under Article 15 of Di- rective 2014/92/EU, credit institutions should make sure that where digital onboarding solu- tions are in place, these also comply with the aforementioned directive and with these guide- lines and that the digital solutions do not produce automated rejections, which would conflict with the directive and these guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:15]
PARAGRAPH_79715: In January 2022, the EBA published an Opinion on de-risking in which it assessed the scale and impact of de-risking in the EU9. De-risking in this context refers to decisions by credit and financial institutions to refuse to enter into or decisions to terminate business relationships with individual customers or categories of customers associated with higher money laundering and terrorist fi- nancing (ML/TF) risk. The EBA found that across the EU, de-risking affected a variety of customers or potential customers of institutions. The EBA made clear that de-risking of entire categories of customers, without due consideration of individual customers' risk profiles, may be unwarranted and a sign of ineffective ML/TF risk management.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:15]
PARAGRAPH_79716: This Opinion led the European Commission to ask the EBA in a letter dated March 2022 to ask the EBA to:

The EBA performed a gap analysis to establish how best to respond to the Commission's request without duplicating existing provisions. On this basis, the EBA recognised that several aspects would indeed benefit from further regulatory clarifications, as it pointed out in its Opinion on de-risking.

PARAGRAPH_79725: The draft guidelines on access to financial services address financial access in a broad sense and provide general principles for the provision of such access for all types of customers. The overall objective of these draft guidelines is to address the main drivers of unwarranted de-risking of legit- imate customers, as identified in the above-mentioned EBA Opinion on de-risking.

PARAGRAPH_79726: The draft guidelines on access to financial services give details on how ML/TF risks associated with certain types of customers can be mitigated effectively, such as by adjusting the intensity of moni- toring measures or by limiting the access to targeted products or services, in line with a risk-based approach. These details are divided into a general part that relates to all types of customers and a more specific part that deals with customers that are likely to be excluded from access to financial services (such as refugees or homeless individuals) and for whom access to financial services is a prerequisite for the fulfilment of their basic or essential needs.

PARAGRAPH_79730: The draft guidelines on access to financial services contain a section on the adjustment of the in- tensity of monitoring measures. A first and general point requests institutions to set out in their policies and procedures how they adjust the level and intensity of monitoring in a way that is com- mensurate with the ML/TF risk associated with the customer, and this point also broadly outlines the steps that these monitoring measures should include. In addition to this broad point covering all types of customers, the EBA evaluated the possibility of providing institutions with more specific and detailed guidance on the adjustment of these monitoring measures in situations where indi- viduals may have credible and legitimate reasons for being unable to provide traditional forms of identity documentation, which are usually required for accessing financial services. Two options have been considered by the EBA in this regard:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:17]
PARAGRAPH_79736: As highlighted by the EBA Opinion on de-risking and the EBA's Consumer Trends Reports10, an in- creasing number of individuals face difficulties opening a bank account. This is leading to the finan- cial exclusion and further marginalisation of such individuals in EU societies. The move towards a cashless society makes access to financial services all the more crucial for fulfilling basic needs.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:17]
PARAGRAPH_79737: As described by several organisations' reports, vulnerable individuals (such as homeless persons or refugees) are particularly affected by these difficulties 11. This is because very often these individu- als are unable to provide traditional forms of identity documentation. Even though the Payment Accounts Directive sets out in Article 16 a 'right of access to a payment account with basic features' for all individuals legally resident in the EU, this can be in conflict with the requirements of Article 13 of the AMLD, which requires financial institutions to 'identify the customer and verify the cus- tomer's identity on the basis of documents'. This due diligence requirement can be a strong disin- centive for institutions to provide access to financial services when a prospective customer is una- ble to provide such documentation.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:17]
PARAGRAPH_79738: As a result of those observations, providing additional guidance to institutions to support them in handling applications for the opening of bank accounts for those individuals with no traditional form of identity documentation proves necessary. Such guidance would equip them to effectively manage financial crime risks whilst not excluding vulnerable customers.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:17] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_79739: To evaluate and accept alternatives in situations where a customer has credible and legitimate rea- sons to be unable to provide traditional forms of identity documentation, institutions would need to implement more granular and tailored policies and procedures for their account opening pro- cess. The draft guidelines on access to financial services would give guidance on the type of docu- ments that could be used in this regard by institutions to facilitate the opening of a bank account for these specific categories of customers. Furthermore, having such policies in place would result in a reputational gain for the institutions, who would be able to demonstrate their commitment to facilitating the financial inclusion of vulnerable customers. As the guidance would apply to all cus- tomers that may have credible and legitimate reasons for being unable to provide traditional forms of identity documentation, this approach would strengthen social inclusion at EU level. In addition to these reputational benefits, institutions could benefit from the incomes - although not signifi- cant - resulting from opening more customer accounts.

PARAGRAPH_79747: As explained above, the draft guidelines on access to financial services first contain general princi- ples that apply to all types of customers and provide details on how ML/TF risks associated with certain types of customers can be mitigated effectively, such as by adjusting the intensity of moni- toring measures and by limiting the access to targeted products or services, in line with a risk-based approach. To enhance the impact of the new guidelines and to monitor their implementation in the institutions, the EBA considered two options:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:18]
PARAGRAPH_79748: Option 2a: Adding a requirement to document the decision to refuse a business relationship and the reason for doing so.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:18]
PARAGRAPH_79750: Decisions made by institutions to reject or terminate a business relationship might have several negative consequences. In addition to the above-mentioned exclusion of vulnerable individuals, the negative consequences can also affect other types of de-risked customers, such as payment insti- tutions, fund managers, FinTech firms, NPOs and diamond-trade businesses. De-risking can unfairly exclude legitimate customers in certain cases. Moreover, once rejected by institutions, these cus- tomers may resort to alternative payment and banking channels where they will be monitored less and, as a consequence, AML/CFT prevention could be hampered. Enhancing the quality and granu- larity of the decision process to de-risk a particular customer is thus crucial, and all the principles disclosed in the current draft guidelines provide added value in this context.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:18]
PARAGRAPH_79751: Nevertheless, in the EBA's view, not documenting the decision and reasons behind the refusal of business relationships would impede institutions' internal controls on correct implementation of EBA's guidance and strongly alter the objectives of the draft guidelines. It would also make effective supervision difficult. Moreover, the requirement to document the decisions will naturally stream- line the entire account opening process before a potential refusal. In addition, documenting the decisions would allow institutions to better defend their decisions in case of claims by rejected customers.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:18]
PARAGRAPH_79752: As this documenting requirement would be a strong pillar supporting the correct implementation of the draft guidelines on access to financial services, it would indirectly trigger reputational gains for the institutions described in the section on Option 1 and would also generate financial income from the opening of more customer accounts.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:18]
PARAGRAPH_79753: As a result, the costs incurred by the requirement to document decisions made to refuse business relationship are more than offset by the above-mentioned benefits.

PARAGRAPH_79759: The afore-mentioned letter from the European Commission of March 2022 requested that the EBA take into consideration some specific situations where de-risking is particularly acute, for instance when it affects individuals that are politically exposed persons ('PEPs') or customers who appear to be excluded from access to financial services because they are subject to the US tax regime (e.g. 'accidental Americans').

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:19]
PARAGRAPH_79760: Based on this suggestion from the European Commission and the EBA's own findings, the EBA con- sidered two options:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:19]
PARAGRAPH_79761: Option 3a: Adding a specific new set of guidelines related to other categories of customers par- ticularly affected by de-risking.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:19]
PARAGRAPH_79762: Option 3b: Not adding a specific new set of guidelines related to other categories of customers particularly affected by de-risking.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:19] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_79763: As mentioned previously, the EBA performed a gap analysis to establish how best to respond to the Commission's request without duplicating existing provisions. As regards PEPs, the RFGLs already provide a number of clarifications that support credit and financial institutions in managing ML/TF risks associated with individual business relationships in an effective manner when customers are PEPs. A detailed guide for institutions on how to approach PEPs is thus not needed. On the other hand, the draft guidelines on access to financial services will apply to all type of customers, includ- ing PEPs. These draft guidelines will as such enhance the effectiveness of institutions' ML/TF risk management when providing PEPs with access to financial services and clarify the different ways of mitigating their ML/TF risks in an efficient manner. The principles in these draft guidelines' will enhance the implementation of the already existing provisions related to PEPs outlined in the RFGLS - for instance, with the requirement to document the decision to refuse or terminate a business relationship and the reason for doing so.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:19]
PARAGRAPH_79764: 'Accidental Americans' who are EU citizens or who legally reside in the EU, are entitled to access to a payment account with basic features, and therefore the draft guidelines on access to financial services that the EBA is proposing are applicable in this context. Therefore, as for PEPs, the appli- cation of these draft guidelines will enhance the effectiveness of institutions' ML/TF risk manage- ment when providing access to financial services to 'accidental Americans'. These draft guidelines will also clarify the different ways to mitigate ML/TF risks in an efficient manner. The EBA in this regard stresses that reporting obligations under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) do not constitute grounds for denying such access under the PAD.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:19]
PARAGRAPH_79765: Therefore, the EBA considered that the specific situation of PEPs, 'accidental Americans' or any other customers (including legal entities) affected by unwarranted de-risking, would be addressed

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:20]
PARAGRAPH_79772: The development of the draft guidelines on policies and controls for the effective ML/TF risk man- agement when providing access to financial services, which clarify the different ways to mitigate ML/TF risks in an efficient manner, was deemed necessary to mitigate the negative impact of un- warranted de-risking and to decrease as a result the exclusion of legitimate and in some cases vul- nerable customers. These new guidelines will improve the due diligence process required at the onboarding stage and in the course of the business relationship, and ultimately will help to improve the social impact of credit and financial institutions. The costs associated with more granular, tai- lored customer due diligence policies and procedures will be exceeded by the afore-mentioned benefits. Hence, these new guidelines should achieve their objective of providing better and fairer access to financial services with acceptable costs.

PARAGRAPH_79791: A respondent argued that these guidelines were only relevant for credit institutions. A respondent asked if the guidelines would also apply to investment services. Respondents asked whether account information services (AIS), payment initiation services (PIS) and payment institutions were in scope.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:21]
PARAGRAPH_79792: As specified in the 'Addressees' section, the guidelines are addressed to credit and financial institutions as defined in Article 3(1) and 3(2) of Directive (EU) 2015/849, which are financial sector operators as defined in Article 4 (1a) of Reg- ulation (EU) No 1093/2010. These are the institutions that are in the EBA's remit in relation to AML/CFT. The guidelines specify the instances in which only credit institutions cov- ered by the PAD requirement are concerned.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:21]
PARAGRAPH_79795: A respondent recommended that the EBA extend the scope of the guidelines on effective manage- ment of ML/TF risks when providing access to fi- nancial services to also include the offering of bank accounts to payment institutions (PIS).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:21] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_79796: The report annexed to the Opinion on de-risking stressed that payment institutions can make decisions to de-risk cus- tomers, but they may also be subject to de-risking by credit institutions. The guidelines cover all types of customers, whether they are individuals, individuals covered by the PAD, or legal entities. However, the EBA considered that de- risking of PIs required a distinct approach from that re- quired for other customers to be effective, and therefore it has decided to tackle this issue in a more detailed manner as part of the current revision of PSD2. Please refer to the EBA's response to the Commission's Call for advice pub- lished in June 2022 for further details.

PARAGRAPH_79808: Several respondents recommended amending the definition of de-risking and aligning it with the FATF definition.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:22]
PARAGRAPH_79809: The EBA acknowledges that its definition of de-risking dif- fers from the FATF's definition. This is because the EBA makes a distinction, as explained in its Opinion on de-risk- ing, between a decision to reject a customer as a result of the application of Article 14(4) of the AMLD and a decision to reject a customer without due consideration of the indi- vidual customer's risk profile (i.e. unwarranted de-risking).

PARAGRAPH_79811: A respondent recommended that the EBA include the risk of 'proliferation financing' and align with the FATF in that regard.

PARAGRAPH_79812: The guidelines are based on the EU AMLD, which does not cover proliferation financing.

PARAGRAPH_79815: The EBA agrees that the guideline should distinguish be- tween asylum seekers and refugees, since both these cate- gories of customers are vulnerable and may face different difficulties to access financial services, because their legal status is different. Therefore, paragraph 19 has been amended to reflect this, as follows:

PARAGRAPH_79831: Several respondents were concerned that these guidelines only cover decisions to reject custom- ers on ML/TF grounds, and not those connected to ESG-related concerns. They argued that credit and financial institutions often rely on ESG consid- erations to justify a blanket refusal or termination of customers.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:23]
PARAGRAPH_79832: For ESG-related concerns, the legal basis of these guidelines is the applicable EU AML/CFT legal framework. These guide- lines consider AML/CFT and thus ESG-related matters to the extent that they are also relevant from an AML perspective.

PARAGRAPH_79850: Several respondents said that not every financial service or product is a prerequisite for participa- tion in society. They were of the view that only payment accounts as envisaged by the PAD are a prerequisite for participation. They also recom- mended defining what a customer is in that con- text, using the definition of 'consumer' as in the PAD. Some were also of the view that the banks' right to decide the level and intensity of the CCD requirements (also in terms of information re- quired) based on the risk of the client should be re-affirmed.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:24]
PARAGRAPH_79851: The paragraph is clear that CDD measures should not result in unduly denying customers legitimate access to financial services. Therefore, this requirement goes beyond the pay- ment account with basic features envisaged by the PAD and that only applies to individuals who are legally residing in the EU. The paragraph is equally clear that institutions should put in place risk-sensitive policies and procedures.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:24]
PARAGRAPH_79853: A respondent asked the EBA to clarify whether the term 'entire categories of customers' included customers suspected or convicted of involvement with organised crime.

PARAGRAPH_79854: The EBA's Guidelines on ML/TF risk factors provide guid- ance on the risk factors to consider when identifying the risk associated with a customer's reputation. This includes alle- gations of criminality or terrorism, or the fact that the cus- tomer is publicly known to be under investigation for ter- rorist activity or has been convicted for terrorist activity. The AMLD furthermore specifies that suspicious transac- tions and other information relevant to money laundering, associated predicate offences and terrorist financing should be reported to the Financial Intelligence Unit (in line with Article 33 of the Directive).

PARAGRAPH_79869: To clarify further paragraph 13 and to reflect the respond- ents' concerns, paragraphs 11 and 13 are amended as fol- lows: 11. Credit and financial institutions should put in place risk-sensitive policies and procedures to ensure that their approach to applying customer due diligence (CDD) measures does not result in unduly denying customers le- gitimate access to financial services. To comply with their obligations under Article 14(4) of Directive (EU) 2015/849, credit and financial institutions should set out in their poli- cies and procedures the criteria they will use to determine on which grounds they will decide that a business relation- ship is rejected or terminated, or a transaction denied. As part of this, credit and financial institutions should set out in their policies, procedures and controls all options for mit- igating higher ML/TF risk that they will consider applying before deciding to reject a customer on ML/TF risk grounds. These options should at least include adjusting the level and intensity of monitoring and, where this is permitted under national law, the application of targeted restrictions to products or services. Institutions' policies and procedures should set out clearly in which situations the application of these mitigating measures may be appropriate.

PARAGRAPH_79880: The requirement in paragraph 14 does not cover infor- mation to be provided to the customer who has been re- jected, but rather information for the competent authori- ties to be able to check whether financial institutions have taken the appropriate steps before making a decision to re- ject the customer.

Credit and financial institutions should document any decision to refuse or terminate a business relationship and the reason for doing so, and Furthermore, they they should be prepared to make this documentation available to their competent authority upon request.

If a client rela- tionship is refused or terminated for other rea- sons (e.g. ESG framework, client non-responsive- ness), documenting the decision would be dispro- portionate and not in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

According to the respondent, if banks were re- quired to document decisions to reject certain le- gal entities, this would put them in the difficult position of having to explain why they reject cor- porate customers in, for instance, the red-light in- dustry (whenever legal in the respective country), where there is no concrete evidence of criminal behaviour, instead of managing the ML/TF risks related to them.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:27]
PARAGRAPH_79890: Several respondents were of the view that this paragraph gives the impression that that CDD re- quirements for basic payment accounts should be less rigorous than regular CDD requirements. Another respondent, for clarity purposes, sug- gested reformulating this paragraph as follows: 'The limited functionalities of a basic payment ac- count help mitigate the risk that the customer could abuse these products and services for finan- cial crime purposes. In relation to the right of ac- cess to a payment account with basic features in accordance with Articles 16(2) and 17 of Directive 2014/92/EU, credit institutions obliged to offer such basic accounts should set out in their ac- count opening policies and procedures how they can adjust their customer due diligence require- ments to account for this fact.'

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:27]
PARAGRAPH_79891: The paragraph makes clear that basic accounts' limited functionalities mitigate the risk that the customer could abuse these accounts for financial crime purposes.

PARAGRAPH_79907: Several respondents commented that this para- graph would benefit from conveying more clearly that there is an expectation of lower monitoring in low-risk cases. A suggestion was to add, at the end of paragraph 18, the following sentence: 'The measures re- ferred to in points a) to c) should be used in a way and with a frequency that is proportionate so as not to constitute an unduly onerous obligation on customers constituting a low risk. Credit and fi- nancial institutions should ensure that ongoing monitoring is less intensive for customers identi- fied as lower risk where they continue to carry out their activities within the profile established under point a).'

PARAGRAPH_79908: The paragraph starts by reminding credit and financial insti- tutions that they should set out in their policies and proce- dures how to adjust the level and intensity of monitoring in a way that is commensurate with the ML/TF risk associated with the customer, as set out in the EBA's Guidelines on risk factors. To ensure further clarity, the paragraph is amended as follows: 18. Credit and financial institutions should set out in their policies and procedures how they adjust the level and in- tensity of monitoring in a way that is commensurate with the ML/TF risk associated with the customer and in line with the customer's risk profile, as set out in the EBA's Guidelines on risk factors and in particular guidelines 4.69 to 4.75

PARAGRAPH_79911: The term refers to enhanced due diligence (EDD) measures set out in Article 18(1), which requires credit and financial institutions to apply EDD measures in cases of links with high-risk third countries or high-risk jurisdictions.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_79921: The EBA's Guidelines on ML/TF risk factors are clear that credit and financial institutions should put in place systems and controls to keep their assessments of the ML/TF risk as- sociated with their business and with their individual busi- ness relationships under review to ensure that their assess- ment of ML/TF risk remains up to date and relevant (see guideline 1.6.). This concerns all customers. Guideline 1.9. is equally clear that the systems and controls that institu- tions should put in place to identify emerging risks should include processes to ensure that internal information, such as information obtained as part of a firm's ongoing moni- toring of business relationships, is reviewed regularly to identify trends and emerging issues in relation to both indi- vidual business relationships and the firm's business. Guide- line 1.10 specifies that firms should determine the fre- quency of wholesale reviews of their business-wide and in- dividual risk assessment methodology on a risk-sensitive basis. These provisions of the EBA's Guidelines on ML/TF risk factors are therefore consistent with the content of par- agraph 18.b.

PARAGRAPH_79923: A respondent asked whether, for refugees and vulnerable customers who are unable to provide traditional documents, a rental agreement or a utility bill would be sufficient to prove residence. Several respondents suggested providing an ex- haustive list of the alternatives that could be used for identification purposes.

PARAGRAPH_79924: Paragraph 19 accounts for the fact that national laws differ across Member States and as a result specifies 'where per- mitted by national law' where relevant. For the same rea- son, the EBA cannot provide an exhaustive list of docu- ments that would be acceptable, since national laws may differ on this aspect. Therefore the possible alternatives presented in this paragraph are for illustrative purposes.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:30]
PARAGRAPH_79932: The EBA notes that the word 'or similar' in the paragraph accounts for the fact that other organisations may be con- sidered. The EBA is also of the view that the term 'working on behalf of official authorities' accounts for the fact that documents provided in this context could be considered as reliable enough.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:30]
PARAGRAPH_79934: Another respondent was of the view that the term 'working on behalf of official authorities' was unduly restrictive and misaligned with local law in several Member States.

This documentation may include ex- pired identity documents and, where permitted under national law, documentation provided by an official authority, such as social services or a well-established not-for-profit organisation work- ing on behalf of official authorities (e.g. Red Cross or similar) which also provides assistance to this customer.'

PARAGRAPH_79954: Several respondents said that the proposal to im- pose targeted restrictions, such as the amount or the number of person-to-person transfers or the amount of transactions to and from third coun- tries is in contradiction with the PAD.

PARAGRAPH_79955: With respect to the point related to the PAD, paragraph 20 clearly distinguishes between restrictions that can be ap- plied by credit institutions covered by the PAD (in para- graph 20.a.) and restrictions that can be applied by institu- tions not covered by PAD-related obligations (in 20.b.).

Several respondents stressed that it was im- portant to ensure that complaint mechanisms are accessible to all. Not all marginalised groups have access to a phone or email, so having the compe- tent authority's or designated alternative dispute resolution body's contact details physically would be key. This would ensure that complaints suc- cessfully reach the intended point of contact. Also, due to lack of access to technology for some marginalised groups, it would be beneficial for them to have the option to mail the EBA to submit complaints to national bodies rather than solely use a weblink. Several respondents said that it was also key to ensure institutions provide written evidence of why an individual person is rejected.

PARAGRAPH_79991: With respect to the first comment, the EBA recalls that the PAD includes a requirement for credit institutions to imme- diately inform the consumer of the refusal and of the spe- cific reason for that refusal unless such disclosure would be contrary to objectives of national security, public policy or the provisions of the AMLD. The AMLD specifies in article 39 that entities subject to it must not disclose to a customer the fact that information is being, will be or has been trans- mitted to the FIU or that a money laundering or terrorist financing analysis is being or may be carried out. This prohi- bition however does not include disclosure to the compe- tent authorities. The PAD also specifies that in the event of refusal, the credit institution must advise the consumer of the procedure to submit a complaint against the refusal, and of the con- sumer's right to contact the relevant competent authority and designated alternative dispute resolution body, and it must provide the relevant contact details. Therefore, the EBA is of the view that the information on the complaint mechanism envisaged in paragraph 22, com- bined with the requirement of documenting the decision to
