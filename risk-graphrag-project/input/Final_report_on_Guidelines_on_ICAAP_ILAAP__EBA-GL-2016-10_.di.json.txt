PARAGRAPH_89129: 1. Executive Summary

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_89130: These Guidelines facilitate the consistent approach to the assessment of institutions' internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) and internal liquidity adequacy assessment process (ILAAP) under the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) and should be read together with the EBA Guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for SREP1 (SREP Guidelines).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_89131: In particular, these Guidelines specify what information regarding ICAAP and ILAAP competent authorities should collect from the institutions in order to perform their assessments following the criteria specified in the SREP Guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_89132: The information to be collected by the competent authorities based on these Guidelines could be broadly categorised as:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]

PARAGRAPH_89137: Recognising that it is the institution's responsibility to determine and apply appropriate approaches to ICAAP and ILAAP that are in accordance with the requirements set out in Directive 2013/36/EU2, these Guidelines refrain from setting specific ICAAP/ILAAP requirements, or prescribing any new criteria for the supervisory assessment of ICAAP or ILAAP. The common set of information items referred to in these Guidelines aim to enhance consistency in the supervisory assessment of the ICAAP and ILAAP frameworks and the reliability of the ICAAP and ILAAP capital and liquidity estimates and their use in the assessment of the institution's capital and liquidity adequacy and for the determination of additional own funds and liquidity requirements in accordance with the SREP Guidelines. In addition to specifying information items, these Guidelines also set general criteria for competent authorities to organise collection of ICAAP and ILAAP information from institutions and to use such information for the purposes of their

When specifying such criteria, these Guidelines recognise the principle of proportionality in relation to the frequency, reference dates and remittance dates, and scope for ICAAP and ILAAP information that should be determined in relation to the SREP categorisation of institutions, minimum supervisory engagement model and supervisory examination programmes. By means of these Guidelines, the EBA does not aim to introduce any specific ICAAP/ILAAP 'report', but identifies information items and their core content, recognising that such information can be provided either through a single report, specifically prepared by an institution for the purposes of ICAAP/ILAAP submissions, or as separate documents that are already available in the bank.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_89153: 1. Article 73 of Directive 2013/36/EU requires institutions to have in place sound, effective and comprehensive strategies and processes to assess and maintain on an ongoing basis the amounts, types and distribution of internal capital that they consider adequate to cover the nature and level of the risks to which they are or might be exposed (which is commonly referred to internal capital adequacy assessment process - ICAAP). Those strategies and processes shall be subject to regular internal review to ensure that they remain comprehensive and proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the activities of the institution concerned.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5] [RISK:LIQUIDITY_RISK] [RISK:REPUTATIONAL_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_89154: 2. Article 86 of Directive 2013/36/EU requires institutions to have robust strategies, policies, processes and systems for the identification, measurement, management and monitoring of liquidity risk over an appropriate set of time horizons and management and monitoring of funding positions, so as to ensure that institutions maintain adequate levels of liquidity buffers and adequate funding (which is commonly referred to as internal liquidity adequacy assessment process - ILAAP). Those strategies, policies, processes and systems shall be tailored to business lines, currencies, branches and legal entities and shall include adequate allocation mechanisms of liquidity costs, benefits and risks. The methodologies for managing and monitoring of funding positions shall include the current and projected material cash-flows in and arising from assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet items, including contingent liabilities and the possible impact of reputational risk.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_89155: 3. The competent authorities review ICAAP and ILAAP as part of the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) performed in accordance with Article 97 of Directive 2013/36/EU and in accordance with the EBA Guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP Guidelines)3.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_89156: 4. Furthermore, the SREP Guidelines provide a set of criteria that competent authorities should consider when assessing ICAAP and ILAAP frameworks and estimates of their internal capital and liquidity calculation. In order to satisfy those assessment criteria the following should be considered:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_89157: a. ICAAP and ILAAP should be consistent with the risk profile and operating environment of an institution, tailored to the institution's circumstances and needs, and it should use the inputs and definitions that the institution normally uses for internal purposes. At the same time, the institution should make ICAAP and ILAAP understandable to the competent authorities and demonstrate that they are sound, effective and comprehensive.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_89158: b. The design of ICAAP and ILAAP frameworks is the responsibility of the institutions. ICAAP and ILAAP should be based on adequate measurement and assessment processes including both quantitative and qualitative elements, and they should be

PARAGRAPH_89163: fully documented. ICAAP and ILAAP should form an integral part of institutions' management processes and should be reviewed on a regular basis. ICAAP and ILAAP should be risk based, covering all material risks to which the institution is or might be exposed, and consider also the regulatory, economic or business environment in which the institution operates.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_89164: c. ICAAP and ILAAP should be forward-looking. Institutions should have an internal strategy for maintaining adequate levels of capital and liquidity taking into account the strategic plans and how they relate to macroeconomic factors.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_89165: d. ICAAP should produce a reasonable overall capital number and assessment. The institution should be able to explain to the competent authorities the calculation methodologies to make ICAAP understandable and the similarities and differences between its ICAAP and its own funds requirements to enable supervisors to compare the outcomes.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_89166: e. ILAAP should produce a credible and understandable assessment and outcome. The institution should be able to explain to the competent authorities the methodologies and calculations used and the risks these are looking to address, and a breakdown and summary of the underlying components of the ILAAP calculations.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_89167: 5. In order to perform supervisory assessments of ICAAP and ILAAP frameworks, and determine whether institutions' ICAAP and ILAAP meet the criteria specified in the SREP Guidelines and above, competent authorities should have access to various ICAAP- and ILAAP-specific and background information, including institutions' policies and methodological documents, operational documents and supporting documents evidencing the use of ICAAP and ILAAP in the risk management and strategic management of an institution.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_89168: 6. The aim of these Guidelines is to ensure convergence of supervisory practices in the assessment of ICAAP and ILAAP as required by the SREP Guidelines by introducing a common set of information that competent authorities will be using in their assessments.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_89169: 7. In particular, the Guidelines specify what information, regarding ICAAP and ILAAP, competent authorities should collect from the institutions in order to perform their assessments:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_89179: 8. In addition to specifying information items, these Guidelines also set general criteria for competent authorities to organise collection of ICAAP and ILAAP information from institutions and using such information for the purposes of their assessments of other SREP elements. When specifying such criteria, these Guidelines recognise the principle of proportionality in relation to the frequency, granularity, reference dates and remittance dates for ICAAP and ILAAP information that should be determined in relation to the SREP categorisation of institutions, minimum supervisory engagement model and supervisory examination programmes.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_89180: 9. In particular, the competent authorities would be expected to receive from Category 1 institutions all information specified in these Guidelines annually by a single set date (which might differ between the specific institutions to reflect the organisation and planning of the SREP process) as a comprehensive package. The scope, format, frequencies, remittance dates and reference dates for the information submissions for non-Category 1 institutions may be different and will be determined by the competent authorities for each category of institutions, or individual institutions, where appropriate, depending on the respective minimum supervisory engagement model and supervisory examination programmes, where appropriate coordinating these arrangements within the colleges of supervisors.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_89181: 10.As provided in the SREP Guidelines, the categorisation of institutions drives the level of the minimum supervisory engagement with an institution, but will also define supervisory expectations of the standards the institution is expected to meet. As a consequence, the SREP categorisation defines the supervisory expectation about the set-up and sophistication of ILAAP and ICAAP including the relevance of some of the information items included in these Guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_89182: 11.Furthermore, proportionality applies also regarding the actual content of the information provided by institutions, and in particular in relation to the depth, detail and scope of the ICAAP and ILAAP documentation. Since in principle all information items specified in these Guidelines could be relevant for both complex and less complex institutions, and taking into account that these Guidelines does not specify the level of detail in which the information items should be covered, no split in information items was made in the Guidelines in relation to proportionality.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_89183: 12. Thus, by means of these Guidelines the EBA does not aim to introduce any specific ICAAP/ILAAP 'report', but identifies information items and their core content, recognising that such information can be provided either through a single report, specifically prepared by an institution for the purposes of ICAAP/ILAAP submissions, or as separate documents that are already available in the bank. The specific form of the submission of information will be determined by the competent authorities when applying these Guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:12]
PARAGRAPH_89245: 14. Competent authorities should require an institution that falls under SREP Category 1 to provide them at least with all information items referred to in these Guidelines on an annual basis. Competent authorities should endeavour to set a single remittance date and a single reference date for all SREP Category 1 institutions; however, depending on the organisation of SREP processes, institution-specific dates may be set, where this is deemed more appropriate.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:12]

PARAGRAPH_89252: b. determine different levels of detail or waive certain specific information items referred to in these Guidelines. When waiving information items, competent authorities should ensure that they have obtained sufficient information to assess the ICAAP and ILAAP frameworks and the reliability of the ICAAP and ILAAP capital and liquidity estimates in accordance with the EBA SREP Guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:13]
PARAGRAPH_89253: 16. Depending on the quality of the information provided and the assessment of whether the document(s) submitted cover all areas specified in these Guidelines, competent authorities may request institutions to provide additional information needed for the assessment of ICAAP and ILAAP within the SREP. Competent authorities should determine the appropriate level of granularity and quantity of information to be provided for the purposes of assessment of ICAAP and ILAAP, through an ongoing supervisory dialogue with an institution within the SREP.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:13] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_89254: 17. The competent authorities should ensure that they receive all relevant information and that this information remains valid and applicable at the remittance date, even in cases where the (production) date of the document is different from the pertinent reference date. Documents related to any information item specified in these Guidelines produced in between the reference date and the remittance date should be included where relevant for ICAAP and ILAAP assessment purposes (taking into account materiality as specified in these Guidelines).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:13]
PARAGRAPH_89255: 18. Competent authorities may, with a view to facilitating the assessment of individual SREP elements following the applied engagement model and supervisory examination programme, request from institutions some specific information referred to in these Guidelines or additional information outside the regular ICAAP and ILAAP submission cycle established in accordance with paragraphs 14 and 15 (e.g. some ILAAP-specific information may be requested for the SREP assessment of liquidity and funding risks, and not necessarily for the assessment of ILAAP itself).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:13]
PARAGRAPH_89256: 19. Where these Guidelines are applied in relation to cross-border banking groups and their entities, and the college of supervisors has been established, competent authorities involved should, in the context of their cooperation for the SREP assessment in accordance with Section 11.1 of the SREP Guidelines, coordinate to the maximum extent possible the dates, means and format referred to in paragraph 12 as well as the exact and detailed scope of each information item consistently for all group entities.

PARAGRAPH_89260: 20. Where information referred to in these Guidelines is requested from institutions in the form of the institutions' own internal documents that do not follow the structure or format set out in these Guidelines, competent authorities should endeavour to ensure structural consistency and comparability, including by requesting institutions to explain by means of 'reader's manual' how and where all information items specified in these Guidelines are covered in the documentation provided.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:14] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_89261: 21. For the purposes of the assessment of ICAAP and ILAAP frameworks and calculations under SREP, competent authorities should ensure that they have received all relevant information items as specified in these Guidelines, taking into account proportionality. Where information items are already available to the competent authorities as part of other activities, competent authorities should require institutions to confirm in the 'reader's manual' that this information remains up to date and there have been no changes to the pertinent documents, or to provide updated information on the changes made to the documents after the last submission. Based on these considerations, competent authorities may decide to omit information items that they possess from other supervisory activities and that remain valid and up to date from the requests for ICAAP and ILAAP information carried out in accordance with paragraphs 14 and 15.

PARAGRAPH_89262: 22. Where information items are available at a very granular level, competent authorities may permit institutions to not submit include every available document in relation to the required information items. When excluding such granular information from submissions, such as supporting documents in relation to local dashboards, meeting minutes and individual key performance indicators, competent authorities should ensure that institutions have provided their general policies governing these items and have mentioned in the 'reader's manual' what information has been excluded from the submission. Competent authorities should, as appropriate, require examples of this information. Competent authorities should ensure that data and documents excluded from submission could nevertheless be required, where this is necessary or appropriate, including for reasons of evidencing the institution's compliance with the regulatory requirements.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:33] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_89558: Institutions should have in place internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) in accordance with Article 73 of Directive 2013/36/EU, as well as internal liquidity adequacy assessment process (ILAAP) in accordance in Article 86 of the same Directive. Competent authorities should assess ICAAP and ILAAP as part of their supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) performed in accordance with Article 97 of Directive 2013/36/EU and the EBA Guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for SREP® (SREP Guidelines).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:33]
PARAGRAPH_89559: The SREP Guidelines provide a set of qualitative criteria that competent authorities should consider in their assessment of ICAAP and ILAAP frameworks, established by institutions as part of their risk management arrangements, as well as the assessment of internal capital and liquidity estimations performed by the institutions under ICAAP and ILAAP.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:33]
PARAGRAPH_89560: In order to perform supervisory assessments of ICAAP and ILAAP frameworks and determine whether institutions' ICAAP and ILAAP meet the criteria specified in the SREP Guidelines, competent authorities should have access to various ICAAP- and ILAAP-specific background information, including documents describing institutions' internal policies and operations documents as well as other supporting documents evidencing the use of ICAAP and ILAAP in the risk management and strategic management decision making process of an institution.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:33]
PARAGRAPH_89561: The collection of ICAAP and ILAAP information from institutions is essential for the performance of SREP assessment. Many competent authorities have already requested institutions in their jurisdictions to provide them with ICAAP and/or ILAAP reports, as well as with other supporting quantitative data, given that such information is not part of the common European supervisory reporting framework. However, the existence of different and perhaps divergent requirements for the provision of the relevant information may hinder harmonisation in the implementation of the SREP Guidelines and put additional burden on institutions, in particular on cross-border banking groups and their entities, which may face different requests for provision of information from the consolidating and host competent authorities. The introduction of the common SREP framework, including common criteria for the assessment of ICAAP and ILAAP, presents a good opportunity to the EBA to introduce further convergence of supervisory practices in the assessment of ICAAP and ILAAP, as required by the SREP Guidelines, by introducing a common set of information that competent authorities will be using in their assessments.

PARAGRAPH_89566: This impact assessment justifies the decision to develop the Guidelines on the EBA's own initiative, focusing on the benefits from the introduction of higher supervisory convergence regarding the collection of ICAAP- and ILAAP-related information. Such convergence would facilitate harmonised assessments, which at the same time would be consistent with the consistent implementation of the SREP Guidelines by competent authorities. Due to the nature of the problem addressed by these Guidelines and the lack of relevant data, only a high-level qualitative assessment has been conducted to access the applicability of the provisions set out in the Guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:34] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_89567: It is noteworthy that the impact assessment quantifies the net impact (although not in monetary terms) from the full implementation of the Guidelines, implying that the costs and benefits from the actual implementation of the Guidelines will be proportionate to the level of implementation in each Member State, i.e. Member States which do not fully implement the Guidelines will incur lower costs but will also benefit less from the advantages of the full implementation.

PARAGRAPH_89568: b. Policy objectives

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:34]
PARAGRAPH_89569: These Guidelines aim to achieve convergence of supervisory practices in the assessment of ICAAP and ILAAP as required by the SREP Guidelines, by introducing a common set of information that competent authorities will be using in their assessments across the EU. In particular, the Guidelines aim to specify what general and ICAAP- and ILAAP-specific information competent authorities should collect from institutions following their minimum engagement model as specified in the SREP Guidelines (more in-depth annual supervisory interaction and assessment of all SREP elements for large and complex Category 1 institutions and risk-based interaction with lower frequency for other categories of institutions).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:34]
PARAGRAPH_89570: In addition to specifying information items, these Guidelines also set general criteria for competent authorities to organise the collection of ICAAP and ILAAP information and specify the use of such information for the purposes of assessing other SREP elements. When specifying such criteria, these Guidelines recognise the principle of proportionality in relation to the frequency, granularity, reference dates and remittance dates for the provision of ICAAP and ILAAP information that should be determined in relation to the SREP categorisation of institutions, minimum supervisory engagement model and supervisory examination programmes.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:34]
PARAGRAPH_89571: To achieve the objective of convergence, the impact assessment should identify whether the specification of common ICAAP and ILAAP information is deemed necessary for the assessment of ICAAP and ILAAP under SREP, and, if so, if the trade-off between the costs and benefits involved in the full implementation of these Guidelines justifies the additional information requests.

PARAGRAPH_89578: It should be noted that:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:35] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_89579: 1. The Guidelines do not introduce a specific ICAAP/ILAAP 'report' but define the information items and their core content. Such information can be provided either through a single report, specifically prepared by an institution for the purposes of ICAAP/ILAAP submissions, or by the provision of separate documents which are already available at the institution. The specific form of the submission of information will be determined by the competent authorities when applying these Guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:35]
PARAGRAPH_89580: 2. Furthermore, the Guidelines do not introduce any specific common templates for the provision of quantitative data to support ICAAP and ILAAP assessments, or introduce common risk taxonomy or methodological considerations other than already specified in the SREP Guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:35] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_89581: 3. In their implementation of the Guidelines, competent authorities, however, may opt for introducing specific ICAAP and/or ILAAP reports based on the requirements of these Guidelines and require institutions to provide information specified in these Guidelines in the form of a specific report. In the national implementation of the Guidelines, competent authorities may also opt to supplement information specified in these Guidelines with specific quantitative information/data that may be necessary for the assessment of ICAAP and ILAAP or for the determination of supervisory benchmarks to be used for the assessment of ICAAP and ILAAP internal estimates.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:35]
PARAGRAPH_89582: It is expected that, even in the absence of regulatory intervention by means of these Guidelines, most of the competent authorities within the EU will anyway request institutions to provide regular ICAAP and ILAAP information for the purposes of SREP assessments that would be more or less similar to the content of these Guidelines. This implies that nevertheless this requirement would introduce additional costs to the involved institutions. In light of this, the regulatory intervention (these Guidelines) will therefore enhance the harmonisation of prudential supervision and will speed up the actual compliance with the SREP Guidelines, making the harmonisation feasible at an earlier stage. This would reduce the costs which would arise from the excessive exchange of information with national supervisors for the provision of ad hoc information and the assignment of resources in doing so.

PARAGRAPH_89584: Option 1: 'Do nothing' (i.e. not to draft these Guidelines)

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:35]
PARAGRAPH_89585: This option implies that competent authorities would continue with their current practices of requesting ICAAP and ILAAP information from institutions either by means of defining approaches at the level of each jurisdiction in a formalised way, or giving freedom to institutions to provide information without any guidance from competent authorities. Under this option, most of the

PARAGRAPH_89588: EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:36]
PARAGRAPH_89589: authorities are likely to provide some guidance to the institutions in their jurisdictions regarding ICAAP and ILAAP information, with some authorities potentially introducing some ICAAP- and ILAAP-specific reports relying on past practices, whereas a limited number of authorities are likely not to provide any guidance, instead relying on information to be provided by institutions themselves, and thus probably requesting additional information that might be necessary for the assessment of criteria introduced in the SREP Guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:36]
PARAGRAPH_89590: This option would not support the consistent implementation of the SREP Guidelines by competent authorities and would not support the level playing field in the assessment of ICAAP and ILAAP across the EU. Under this option some institutions would be subject to the ICAAP/ILAAP reporting guidance issued by competent authorities in an uncoordinated fashion, whereas others might not face such requirements. Such divergence in the approaches applied is likely to bring disproportionate costs to some institutions compared with others.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:36]
PARAGRAPH_89591: The 'do nothing' option would also not facilitate supervision of cross-border banking groups and their entities and the functioning of colleges of supervisors, as competent authorities and colleges would have different information for their assessment, which is likely to lead to additional information requests, bringing extra costs to institutions.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:36] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_89592: The benefit of the 'do nothing' option is in preserving the current status quo, where some authorities might continue prescribing delivery and content of ICAAP- and ILAAP-specific information, whereas other authorities would not provide guidance and would rely entirely on information provided by institutions for their assessments. Therefore, there would be no change in practices or additional costs for institutions in any of the cases. Maintaining the status quo, however, might not be possible in the long run, especially for authorities that do not provide any guidance to institutions, as in order to be compliant with the SREP Guidelines and assess institutions' ICAAP and ILAAP using the criteria provided in the SREP Guidelines they would need to have additional information that is not currently being requested from institutions.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:36]
PARAGRAPH_89593: To sum up, Option 1 can be analysed as follows:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:36] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_89594: Benefits: one-off 'opportunity' benefits (e.g. in terms of total operating cost for competent authorities and institutions) to competent authorities that do not currently provide any guidance to institutions regarding ICAAP and ILAAP information from the supervised institutions, as well as benefits to the institutions in such jurisdictions. Such benefits are limited, as both competent authorities and institutions would still need to change their approaches, as they would need to comply with updated ICAAP and ILAAP assessment criteria in the SREP Guidelines. In addition, Option 1 would present benefits from avoiding the need to dedicate staff from the EBA and competent authorities to draft and monitor the implementation of the Guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:36]
PARAGRAPH_89595: Costs: ongoing costs of compliance with the SREP Guidelines, as competent authorities and institutions would need to adjust their processes in order to have ICAAP and ILAAP information and perform the assessments of ICAAP and ILAAP in accordance with the

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:37]
PARAGRAPH_89601: Option 2: To introduce the harmonisation of ICAAP and ILAAP collection of information from institutions by specifying the types of the required qualitative and quantitative information and providing criteria for the organisation of the collection process.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:37] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_89602: This option would support the consistent implementation of the SREP Guidelines and provide competent authorities with the basic set of information needed to assess ICAAP and ILAAP frameworks and calculations against the criteria specified in the SREP Guidelines. This option would not introduce additional costs for institutions or competent authorities that have already specified the requested ICAAP and ILAAP information aligned with the criteria set in the current Guidelines. However, the competent authorities which have not established similar approaches or do not have any approach for requesting information are likely to update their own guidance and their internal processes to meet the requirements of the SREP Guidelines. Therefore, this policy option is likely to introduce additional costs to the national supervisors as well as to the reporting institutions that are currently not subject to any specification/guidance regarding ICAAP and ILAAP information.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:37] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_89603: Considering the need for the consistent implementation of the SREP Guidelines and common criteria for ICAAP and ILAAP assessment, the scope of information regarding ICAAP and ILAAP that competent authorities need to request from institutions (where national guidance is currently provided), or institutions will need to provide to the competent authorities (where no guidance is currently provided), will need to change in order to provide sufficient basis for the assessment as required by the SREP Guidelines. Against this background, competent authorities and institutions will be subject to additional costs in any event, as they would need to implement the SREP Guidelines (the impact of these changes has been assessed in the separate impact assessment of the SREP Guidelines). Therefore, the benefit of these Guidelines will be in providing a consistent basis for the changes in information ICAAP and ILAAP information to be requested/provided and thus facilitating the implementation of the SREP Guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:37]
PARAGRAPH_89604: Furthermore, while harmonising the set of ICAAP- and ILAAP-related information under Option 2, the Guidelines also provide a certain flexibility by means of allowing a proportionate approach to be applied to smaller and less complex institutions (non-Category 1 institutions according to the classification of the SREP Guidelines). Following the principle of proportionality, for non-Category 1 institutions competent authorities would determine reference dates and remittance dates, might waive some information items ex ante, and would specify the format for the submission of ICAAP and ILAAP information that would best suit their supervisory needs, where appropriate coordinating these arrangements within the colleges of supervisors. This would furthermore reduce the costs of compliance with these Guidelines for institutions.

PARAGRAPH_89609: To sum up, Option 2 can be analysed as follows:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:38]
PARAGRAPH_89610: Benefits: The benefits of this option (e.g. in terms of total operating cost for competent authorities and institutions) arise from introducing greater convergence and consistency into collection of ICAAP- and ILAAP-specific information from institutions, which would facilitate greater consistency in the SREP assessments of ICAAP and ILAAP frameworks and internal capital and liquidity calculations, and thus positively contributing to more consistent implementation of the SREP Guidelines across the EU. The option would also offer benefits to cross-border institutions, as they would be subject to more consistent and coordinated requests for ICAAP- and ILAAP-specific information by the consolidating and host competent authorities.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:38]
PARAGRAPH_89611: Costs: As almost all authorities in the EU already provide structured requests for ICAAP- and ILAAP-specific information from institutions (including by means of specific guidance to institutions), and would need to amend such requests for the purposes of the implementation of the SREP Guidelines, additional costs from the harmonised approach introduced in these Guidelines are implied, although negligible, due to the expected amendment in the structure and content of such requests for the purposes of the implementation of the SREP Guidelines. Non-Category 1 institutions, especially in the Member States where competent authorities have not provided ex ante guidance regarding ICAAP and ILAAP information submission by institutions, may be subject to additional costs from the implementation of these Guidelines, but these are mitigated by the flexibility in relation to the application of the principle of proportionality.

The high-level cost-benefit analysis indicates that Option 2 is proposed for implementation, i.e. developing Guidelines that introduce common approach to the specification of ICAAP- and ILAAP-specific information for the purposes of the assessment of ICAAP and IALLP in accordance with the SREP Guidelines.

PARAGRAPH_89626: The comments were mostly supportive of the proposal; however, many respondents have made the point that these Guidelines should not introduce any new ICAAP or ILAAP requirements or new assessment criteria, but the EBA should stick to the existing ICAAP and ILAAP assessment criteria introduced in the EBA SREP Guidelines. Furthermore, respondents suggested that competent authorities need to justify why they need all the requested information as well as to clarify the level of detail expected in the information, in particular as regards the methodologies and models used within ICAAP and ILAAP.

PARAGRAPH_89648: Some respondents asked for a more coordinated and aligned procedure between the EBA GL and the ECB supervisory expectations on ICAAP/ILAAP 9 in respect of gathering information and on the required content. It was observed that banks should be able to have a flexible approach in their capital planning, allowing appropriate conservatism of risk management. This was indicated in relation to the ECB's expectation of more conservatism regarding governance arrangements than the baseline described.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:42]
PARAGRAPH_89661: In contrast to liquidity contingency plans, there is no legal obligation to have stand-alone capital contingency plans under the CRR/CRD. However, contingency planning should form a part of robust capital planning in general.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:42]
PARAGRAPH_89662: In some cases, respondents suggested that the EBA consider harmonisation of some types of risks in order to prevent divergence, i.e. to consider a risk taxonomy used for supervisory purposes. According to one respondent, the data collection under the draft GL is not fully aligned content-wise with the SREP GL, resulting in a lack of consistency, transparency and reconcilability. This makes it unclear, both for NAs and for banks, which information in the data collection in accordance with the draft ICAAP/ILAAP GL covers which requirements in the SREP GL. The indicated non- alignment also results in setting additional priorities compared with the SREP GL, i.e. 'gold plating' the SREP GL, and potentially threatens the overall objective of EU-wide harmonisation.

competent authorities would need to assess as part of SREP assessment. The actual assessment criteria and elements are described in the EBA SREP Guidelines. It is noted that the information will be used by the competent authorities primarily for the assessment of ICAAP and ILAAP frameworks, but also for the purposes of the assessments of business models and strategy, overall internal governances and institution-wide controls, as well as assessment of risks to liquidity and funding and liquidity adequacy. In this light the list of information items should be seen in the broader context.

PARAGRAPH_89675: In relation to Section 3.2, a respondent observed that it is unclear whether the definition of ILAAP includes the two dimensions introduced in the SREP GL: (i) ensuring that the level of liquidity risk taken by the bank is not excessive, and (ii) that the bank has appropriate risk management policies, processes and systems. Additionally, ILAAP could be interpreted in terms of the institution's self-assessment, providing a third dimension, which is not mentioned elsewhere in the GL, except for paragraph 7.8.54.k. The following drafting of paragraph 7.8.54.k was recommended: 'where available, internal self-assessment in which the institutions can take the opportunity to justify their level of compliance against publicly available criteria regarding risk management and control that affect ILAAP.'

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:43] [RISK:LIQUIDITY_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_89676: the actual collection of information from institutions, the respective competent authorities will advise institutions on the scope, timelines and format for the information to be provided. The EBA notes that ILAAP is defined in the SREP Guidelines as 'process for the identification, measurement, management and monitoring of liquidity implemented by the institution pursuant to Article 86 of Directive 2013/36/EU', which does not necessarily mean that this is a self-assessment exercise rather than a risk management process. The EBA acknowledges that institutions may employ self-assessment-type exercises as part of their ILAAP (and risk management); hence, this is also included in the information to be collected. Such self- assessments that are referred to in these Guidelines could usually include own assessment of compliance with regulatory requirements. The EBA, however, by virtue of these Guidelines does not set any expectations of having self-assessment as a mandatory element.

PARAGRAPH_89699: Many respondents felt that the amount of information required for ICAAP and ILAAP (in particular for G-SIBs) is too extensive and supervisors may not be able to validate and evaluate all the information provided. It was proposed that this should be examined with respect to the principle of materiality and cost- benefit considerations.

PARAGRAPH_89700: ICAAP and ILAAP are important elements of institution-wide risk management and controls and have to be assessed by the competent authorities following the requirements of SREP Guidelines. Given the internal nature of ICAAP and ILAAP, no data is available through the standardised regular reporting, and therefore collection of information is required in order to carry out supervisory assessment as required by the SREP Guidelines.

PARAGRAPH_89709: for the purposes of ICAAP and ILAAP assessments will also be used by competent authorities for other supervisory activities, and assessments of other SREP elements (e.g. business model analysis, assessment of stress testing programmes etc). In order to account for the principle of proportionality, competent authorities can set different levels of detail or waive specific information items depending on the institution's category. It should also be noted that most of the information mentioned in these Guidelines should be generally available within the institutions, as this reflects good risk management practice (with the only exception being the 'reader's manual').

PARAGRAPH_89711: The EBA agrees with the concern regarding the level of detail of model documentation, and acknowledges that by default there should be a general description of the key features of models and assumptions, with additional details provided upon request.

Some respondent proposed that, given the volume of documentation required, there should be a note included that the information does not need to be in paper form. One respondent suggested it should be clearly stated that there is no prescribed format for the submission of the requested information. Another respondent, however, was concerned that the content of current ICAAP and ILAAP aims for standardised information provision, proposing that the EBA should stress that it does not seek a 'template' approach, as both processes of ICAAP and ILAAP are internal for each institution.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:46] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_89724: noted, however, that competent authorities usually require more detailed information than management bodies, as they also need to assess the use of information by the management body and assess whether the information presented to the management body is accurately reflecting the institution's risk profile and is reliable. It is not the intention of the Guidelines to specify any specific forms, formats, or templates for the submission of ICAAP and ILAAP information, but rather to indicate the scope of information to be collected by the competent authorities. Following the requirements of paragraph 12 of the Guidelines, competent authorities should set operational procedures and communicate to the supervised institutions, inter alia requirements regarding the technical means and formats for the provision of information, which may also include pre-defined templates to be used for the provision of some quantitative information, but recognising that both ICAAP and ILAAP should be institution-specific. The EBA will be assessing the practical implementation of the Guidelines as part of its convergence assessment work and, based on these activities, may amend the Guidelines or issue additional guidance in the future.

PARAGRAPH_89797: Respondents suggested that the information requested under this paragraph is extensive and redundant, as it is already provided as part of A-IRB applications. CAs would be unable to assess the documentation for all supervised entities. Several respondents observed that many small financial institutions often outsource risk management structures to specialised external service providers. In this regard some respondents asked for examples of how small financial institutions would comply with the requirement under this paragraph. Most of the respondents suggested that the external service provider could deliver a standardised description that may be supplemented when needed with an institution-specific description.

The EBA also notes that the overall principle of proportionality applies throughout the Guidelines, and, unless competent authorities explicitly specify the level of detail or metrics, it is for the institutions to decide how to populate such information items. As for the description of models and methodologies, the EBA notes that the focus is on the general descriptions of their key features and assumptions. Furthermore, outsourcing of certain functions does not relinquish the institutions' responsibility for such functions, including risk management, and therefore institutions should both retain control over the outsourced functions and ensure access for the competent authorities to supervise such outsourced activities (see CEBS Guidelines on outsourcing).

There was no intention to introduce any new disclosure obligations, as institutions are already expected to disclose some ICAAP and ILAAP information in accordance with Article 438(a) of the CRR. However, based on the received feedback, the EBA dropped the specific section (former Section 5.5) on disclosures, but included references to the ICAAP and ILAAP information disclosed in the 'reader's manual' that institutions have to prepare and added a specific item on the impact of the disclosure made by institutions for the feasibility and timeliness of management actions included in the liquidity contingency plan.

PARAGRAPH_89832: Respondents stated the relevance of recognition of inter-risk diversification, in particularly with respect to cross-border groups. According to one respondent, non-consideration would create misalignment between the management approach and the approach to capital assessment. The same respondent also asked for further clarification of the meaning of 'risk concentrations'. If the paragraphs are referring to intra- and inter-risk concentration, then risk concentration impact should be considered with regard to the benefit of inter- risk diversification.

PARAGRAPH_89833: The EBA position on non-recognition of benefits from inter-risk diversification for the purposes of the determination of additional own funds requirements has been formulated and publicly consulted on in the SREP Guidelines (see Section 7.2.1 of SREP Guidelines). However, institutions may recognise any form of diversification for their internal purposes. Risk concentrations refer to concentrations within a
risk category but also among risk categories.

PARAGRAPH_89847: According to some respondents some sub-categories are mitigated in a qualitative manner, while some risk categories might not be provided on a granular level. If there is no unified taxonomy that would allow comparability, it is unclear how banks would proceed if risk types are not quantified with economic capital.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:53] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_89848: In accordance with Article 73 of the CRD, institutions should, inter alia, assess and maintain internal capital that they consider adequate to cover the nature and level of risks they are or might be exposed to. The EBA expects institutions to cover in ICAAP at least all material risks (see CEBS Guidelines Section 5.6.2), meaning that internal capital estimates should be provided for all material risks. Where an institution believes that risks should not be covered by capital, but be mitigated in a qualitative manner, it should be explained accordingly. Irrespective of the existence of the common risk taxonomy, the EBA expects institutions to have their own understanding of material risks they are or might be exposed to and thus address those risks within ICAAP (and ILAAP). The EBA, though, agrees with the observations regarding the risk taxonomy and notes that there is ongoing work in this respect.

PARAGRAPH_89852: The EBA notes that, according to the SREP Guidelines, the assessment of capital adequacy and determination of additional own funds requirements are made on a risk-by-risk basis. In order to inform such assessment by an institution's own view and capital estimates, competent authorities would expect to see ICAAP estimates also broken down on a risk-by-risk basis.

PARAGRAPH_89937: While not explicitly stated in the paragraph, according to one respondent the paragraph made reference to LCR and NSFR. The respondent proposed that the EBA make an explicit reference to the EBA funding plan templates where LCR/NSFR forecast is required, and state that it is sufficient for meeting the requirement under this paragraph. It was also indicated that compliance with the requirements is already assured by banks in their financial planning process, in the context of the annual budget and/or multi-year strategic plan.

PARAGRAPH_89986: Since the term 'liquid assets' is already used in the SREP Guidelines and is more understandable than the suggested replacement, the EBA finds it reasonable to keep the same wording in the Guidelines.

PARAGRAPH_89994: The term 'buffer of liquid assets' refers to the term 'liquidity buffer' from Delegated Regulation 2015/61. Furthermore, the EBA finds it appropriate to use the same terminology as in the SREP Guidelines, where the term 'liquidity buffer' is used.

According to one respondent the phrase 'performed by independent validation function' does not indicate what specific requirements there are concerning independence, and suggested deletion of this paragraph.

PARAGRAPH_90062: The EBA notes that validation of the models and their outcomes by a party independent of the model development is considered good risk management practice. Furthermore, competent authorities would expect models used for the calculation of capital requirements to be internally validated, by analogy with the models used for the calculation of minimum own funds requirements, in order to ensure the reliability of model outcomes.

The requirement to allocate ICAAP and ILAAP quantitative metrics across institutions stems from the level of application of ICAAP and ILAAP, which according to CRD is not only the consolidating level (see also Section 2 of the Guidelines defining its scope and level of application).

PARAGRAPH_90127: Some respondents observed that the proportionality clause contained in the draft GL depends on whether the competent authorities are actually provided with proposed discretion in the supervision of non-Category 1 institutions defined under the SREP GL.

This information may be contained in documents with a different production date from the reference date as long as the content is applicable at the remittance date. Documents related to any information item specified in these Guidelines produced between the reference date and the submission date should be included where relevant for ICAAP and ILAAP (taking into account materiality as specified in these Guidelines).

Furthermore, competent authorities may omit specific information items from their request in accordance with paragraph 21. It is noted, however, that all relevant documents should be provided to the competent authorities.

PARAGRAPH_90219: Some respondents suggested that information submitted under this paragraph should include decisions on management actions related to intraday liquidity risk. Since intraday liquidity consists of a large number of daily decisions and actions and since the term 'where relevant' is relatively undetermined, it was proposed to delete the paragraph.

PARAGRAPH_90224: Respondents suggested that the requirement to submit the changes to the business model, strategy etc. under paragraphs 55.a and 55.b constitutes interference in the management area of responsibility, and that the requirements should be restricted to material changes.

PARAGRAPH_90225: One of the important aspects of the assessment of ICAAP and ILAAP frameworks is their integration into risk management and use in the decision making of an institution. To this end, competent authorities need to understand how ICAAP and ILAAP are used in decision making and may influence business models and strategies. This is by no means considered interference in the management area of responsibility, but is rather seeking evidence in support of the actual use of ICAAP and ILAAP (i.e. 'use test'). The EBA, however, agrees that to reduce the reporting burden such information should be provided in relation to material changes only.

PARAGRAPH_90240: these Guidelines reflect to a great extent existing practices of such authorities and aim at their harmonisation and better coordination between the authorities. Also, based on the experience of the authorities collecting structured information for their assessments of ICAAP and ILAAP, information requested from the institutions is generally readily available, at least in the form of internal documents. Furthermore, the Guidelines do not prescribe any specific format or templates, and they allow competent authorities to collect information in the form of institution-specific internal documents. Against these considerations, it was considered not feasible to carry out quantitative cost analysis (also for the purposes of the cost-benefit analysis of such quantitative cost collection).
