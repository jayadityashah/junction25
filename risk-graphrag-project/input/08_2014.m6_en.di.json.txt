PARAGRAPH_26283: (26) The FIN-FSA recommends that IT systems and data warehouses required for creating central services be geographically separated into at least two places with different risk profiles.

PARAGRAPH_26285: (28) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities' contingency planning also cover outsourced activities in as far as core functions and services must be maintained during emergency conditions.

A supervised entity subject to contingency planning requirements should, for example, test an external supplier's contingency plan in joint trial runs with the supplier.
