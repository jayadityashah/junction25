PARAGRAPH_74084: 1. Executive summary

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_74085: Article 21b of Directive 2013/36/EU introduced a requirement for institutions belonging to third- country groups to have an intermediate EU parent undertaking (IPU) established in the Union, where the total value of assets in the Union of the third-country group is equal to or greater than EUR 40 billion.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_74086: The EBA considers that a common methodology for calculating the total value of assets in the Union as well as consistent supervisory expectations are essential for ensuring consistent application of the IPU requirement. Therefore, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, the EBA decided to provide this necessary guidance to the institutions that are part of third-country groups operating in the Union and to the competent authorities responsible for supervision over the institutions and branches belonging to the third-country groups.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_74087: Following the suggestion of the European Commission expressed in its letter to the EBA, the guidelines clarify the relevant dates for the calculation of the total value of the assets in the Union, taking into account the fluctuation in the value of assets. In particular, the guidelines specify that for the purpose of the application of the IPU requirement, the total value of assets in the Union of the third-country group should be calculated as an average over the last four quarters. This value should be monitored on a quarterly basis and communicated to relevant competent authorities.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_74088: In order to meet the IPU requirement in a timely manner it is necessary that institutions belonging to third-country groups apply a forward-looking approach. It is therefore specified that they should assess at least annually whether the threshold is expected to be reached within the three-year horizon, based on the strategic planning of the third-country group and the forecast of assets. For the purpose of both the quarterly assessments and the annual forward-looking monitoring, institutions and branches belonging to a third-country group should exchange between each other all necessary information.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_74089: In addition, these guidelines specify certain procedural aspects related to the monitoring of the threshold by competent authorities and the establishment of the IPU where necessary. In particular, clarification is provided on the notifications required by Article 21b(6) of Directive 2013/36/EU, namely that these are to be provided to the EBA on an annual basis. In addition, certain exceptional situations are specified where competent authorities may identify appropriate timelines for the establishment of an IPU, no longer than up to two years from reaching the threshold. Relevant competent authorities should coordinate and take necessary measures to ensure adequate implementation of the IPU requirement.

PARAGRAPH_74093: 2. Background and rationale

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_74094: 2.1 Introduction

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_74095: 1. The Directive (EU) 2019/878 (CRD V) introduced in the prudential framework a requirement for certain third-country groups to have an intermediate EU parent undertaking (IPU), with a view to ensuring the consolidated supervision of the EU activities of such groups and facilitating the resolution of those activities.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_74096: 2. Article 21b of Directive 2013/36/EU requires that two or more institutions in the Union which are part of the same third-country group as defined in Article 3(1), point (64) of Directive 2013/36/EU, in the sense that these institutions are all subsidiaries of a parent undertaking established in a third country, have a single IPU that is established in the Union, where the combined total value of assets of the group in the Union is equal to or greater than EUR 40 billion (IPU threshold). The total value of assets in the Union includes the assets of any institutions belonging to the third-country group as well as any branches authorised to operate in the Union1. Under certain circumstances, in particular in the case of mandatory requirements for separation of activities imposed in some third countries, and subject to approval by competent authorities, it is allowed to set up two IPUs for a third-country group operating in the EU. Such possibility is granted under Article 21b(2) of Directive 2013/36/EU. However, regardless of whether a third-country group is subject to any requirements on separation of activities or not, the calculation of the IPU threshold remains the same and requires aggregation of financial information on all institutions and branches authorised in the Union and belonging to the same third-country group.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_74097: 3. The terms "institution", "EU parent institution" and "parent undertaking" should be understood as in Article 3(3) of Directive 2013/36/EU.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_74098: 4. As clarified in Article 21b(3) of Directive 2013/36/EU, the IPU may take the form of an authorised credit institution, or a financial holding company or a mixed financial holding company that has been granted approval in accordance with Article 21a of Directive 2013/36/EU. Where none of the institutions operating in the Union which are part of a third-country group is a credit institution, the IPU may take the form of an authorised investment firm. In addition, where a second IPU must be set up in connection with investment activities to comply with a mandatory requirement as referred to under Article 21b(2), point (a) of Directive 2013/36/EU, the second IPU may be an authorised investment firm.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_74099: 1 The composition of the total value of assets in the Union is given in Art 21b(5): " ... the total value of assets in the Union of the third-country group shall be the sum of the following:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_74100: (a) the total value of assets of each institution in the Union of the third-country group, as resulting from its consolidated balance sheet or as resulting from their individual balance sheet, where an institution's balance sheet is not consolidated; and

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_74101: (b) the total value of assets of each branch of the third-country group authorised in the Union in accordance with this Directive, Directive 2014/65/EU or Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council."

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_74105: 5. Finally, Article 21b(8) of Directive 2013/36/EU specifies a transitional period for implementing the requirement by clarifying that " ... third-country groups operating through more than one institution in the Union and with a total value of assets in the Union equal to or greater than EUR 40 billion on 27 June 2019 shall have an intermediate EU parent undertaking or, if paragraph 2 applies, two intermediate EU parent undertakings by 30 December 2023."

PARAGRAPH_74106: 2.2 Legal basis and scope of the guidelines

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_74107: 6. The European Commission sent to the EBA a letter dated 3 June 2020 encouraging the EBA to provide guidance on certain technical aspects of the calculation of the IPU threshold, for instance:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_74108: " how to determine the relevant cut-off date for the calculation of the total value of the assets in the EU; and

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_74109: · how to take into account the fluctuation in the amount of EU assets when calculating the threshold.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_74110: 7. The EBA considers that a common methodology for calculating the IPU threshold as well as consistent supervisory expectations are essential for ensuring consistent application of the IPU requirement. Therefore, the EBA decided to provide this necessary guidance both to the institutions that are part of third-country groups operating in the Union and to the competent authorities responsible for supervision over the institutions and branches belonging to the third- country groups.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_74111: 8. Branches belonging to third-country groups as referred to in Article 21b(5), point (b) of Directive 2013/36/EU should be included within the scope of these guidelines and competent authorities authorising or supervising those branches should ensure that they comply with them.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_74112: 9. Against this background, the EBA adopts these guidelines on its own initiative and in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, according to which the EBA "shall, with a view to establishing consistent, efficient and effective supervisory practices within the ESFS, and to ensuring the common, uniform and consistent application of Union law, issue guidelines addressed to all competent authorities or all financial institutions and issue recommendations to one or more competent authorities or to one or more financial institutions".

PARAGRAPH_74113: 2.3 Specifications on the calculation and monitoring of the threshold

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_74114: 10. There is a need to determine how the total value of assets in the Union of a third-country group should be calculated in accordance with Article 21b(5) of Directive 2013/36/EU. For that purpose, the guidelines specify that the calculation is made by adding the assets of the EU parent institutions of that group consolidated in accordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (prudential consolidation) at the highest level of consolidation in the Union to the individual assets of institutions that are not part of a group subject to consolidated supervision pursuant to Article 111 of Directive 2013/36/EU ("stand-alone institutions") and to the assets of the branches of that group referred to in Article 21b(5), point (b) of Directive 2013/36/EU.

PARAGRAPH_74117: FINAL REPORT ON THE EBA GUIDELINES ON THE MONITORING OF THE IPU THRESHOLD

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_74118: 11.To ensure convergence of the calculation of the threshold across the Union, such calculation should be based on reliable data: where financial information provided for the purpose of supervisory reporting is available, that information should be used, while where such financial information is not available, interim financial information should be used.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_74119: 12.To determine in a harmonised way where the threshold set out in Article 21b(4) of Directive 2013/36/EU has been reached having regard to the fluctuation in the value of assets, these guidelines clarify that the threshold is deemed as reached where the average of the total value of assets in the Union of a third-country group over the previous four quarters, equals or exceeds EUR 40 billion.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_74120: 13.Equally there is a need to specify in a prudent but proportionate way, having also regard to the need for financial stability in the Union, when the threshold set out in Article 21b(4) of Directive 2013/36/EU is deemed as no longer exceeded and the relevant institutions of the third-country group are relieved from their obligation to have an IPU established in the Union. To that end, these guidelines specify that the threshold is deemed as no longer exceeded, where the total value of assets in the Union of a third-country group remains below EUR 40 billion for twelve consecutive quarters and there are no reasonable expectations it will increase again above EUR 40 billion.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_74121: 14.Monitoring of the threshold by institutions that are part of a third-country group should be forward-looking, so that the institutions that are part of that group are able to perform their obligations under Article 21b of Directive 2013/36/EU when the threshold is exceeded. To that end, at least annually the threshold should be assessed against the strategic planning and the forecast of assets for the time horizon of at least three years for the group in its entirety ("forward-looking monitoring").

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_74122: 15.These guidelines should also specify how institutions that are part of a third-country group should monitor the threshold set out in Article 21b(4) of Directive 2013/36/EU. It is therefore clarified that EU parent institutions and stand-alone institutions that are part of a third-country group should be the ones performing the relevant quarterly assessments and the annual forward-looking monitoring for the group as a whole. Upon their establishment the quarterly assessment should be performed by the IPUs only, and the forward-looking monitoring is no longer necessary.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_74123: 16.Having regard to the transitional provision set out in Article 21b(8) of Directive 2013/36/EU, it should be determined that the total value of assets in the Union of these third-country groups should be calculated on a point-in-time basis as at 27 June 2019 and not on the basis of any average. Where the value at that date is not available, the total value of assets as at 30 June 2019 should be used, as an approximation of the value as at 27 June 2019. Additionally, where Article 21b(8) of Directive 2013/36/EU applies, the threshold should be deemed as reached only where on 30 December 2023, the average of the total value of assets in the Union of the group over the previous four quarters equals or exceeds EUR 40 billion.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_74128: 17.In order to be able to perform quarterly assessments and the forward-looking monitoring, these guidelines should specify that institutions and branches of a third-country group should exchange between each other all relevant information.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_74129: 18.To enable institutions that are part of third-country groups but are not themselves EU parent institutions or stand-alone institutions performing the quarterly assessment to discharge their obligation under Article 21b Directive 2013/36/EU, these guidelines should specify that the EU parent undertakings make these assessments available to their subsidiaries.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_74130: 19.Further to the information on the quarterly assessments that should be submitted to the competent authorities, there is a need to ensure that EU parent institutions and stand-alone institutions of a third-country group, where they expect that their third-country group will reach the threshold within the next three years based on the forward-looking monitoring, alert the competent authority that is to be determined as the consolidating supervisor in accordance with paragraphs (3) and (5) of Article 111 of Directive 2013/36/EU under the assumption that all institutions authorised in the Union were part of a group subject to consolidated supervision pursuant to that Article 111 having the same parent EU financial holding company ("consolidating supervisor"), or as appropriate, where none of the institutions of a third-country group is a credit institution, the competent authority that is to be determined as the group supervisor in accordance with Article 46 of Directive (EU) 2019/2034 ("group supervisor").

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_74132: 20. These guidelines should set out that competent authorities should make every effort to ensure that institutions and branches comply with their obligations under Article 21b of Directive 2013/36/EU. It is also very important that competent authorities ensure that third-country branches properly report all assets corresponding to their activities in the Union, thereby fully complying with their obligation set out in Article 47(1a), point (a) of Directive 2013/36/EU.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_74133: 21. There is also a need to specify in a convergent way how competent authorities should notify to the EBA the information specified in Article 21b(6) of Directive 2013/36/EU: competent authorities should provide the information they have received from the institutions and branches to the EBA on an annual basis without undue delay and no later than 30 June of any given year, while the total value of assets of each supervised institution or branch should be notified as the average of the total value of assets over the four quarters of the previous calendar year.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_74134: 22.Where a competent authority determined as the consolidating or group supervisor has received the forward-looking notification, it should liaise with the notifying institution and with other relevant authorities. A number of issues should be determined at this early stage, such as whether the derogation referred to in Articles 21b(2) and 21b(3), second indent, of Directive 2013/36/EU should apply to this particular third-country group and the timeline for the establishment of the IPU should be set.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_74138: 23.To ensure financial stability in the Union, while determining the relevant timeline for the establishment of the IPU, competent authorities should, in principle, ensure that the IPU will be in operation at the moment the threshold has been reached.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_74139: 24.To ensure proportionality, it should be possible for competent authorities to provide the relevant institutions with a longer timeline, where this is deemed appropriate, in particular where reaching of the threshold was not foreseeable in the forward-looking monitoring of the threshold (for instance due to mergers and acquisitions not foreseeable in the strategic planning) or where there is a reasonable anticipation of the total value of that group's assets to permanently drop below the threshold within one year from reaching the threshold.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_74140: 25.To ensure convergence in providing longer timelines as per the previous paragraph, there is a need to set out a maximum timeline that can be set by the competent authorities, which in principle should not exceed one year from the date the threshold has been met. In exceptional cases, where justified by specific circumstances, competent authorities may set out a maximum timeline of up to two years after the date the threshold was reached.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_74141: 26.There is a need to set out that where the threshold has been exceeded but an IPU has not been established, the competent authorities of the institutions of that third-country group should coordinate among themselves in order to take all the measures necessary to ensure that Article 21b of Directive 2013/36/EU is complied with.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_74142: 27.To ensure proportionality, the consolidating supervisor and, where applicable, the group supervisor and the competent authorities should be able to permit, following a request by the third-country group, the restructuring of that third-country group such that it no longer has the IPU before the end of the period of twelve quarters, where the total value of assets in the Union has dropped significantly and permanently below the threshold as a result of strategic changes in European operations of the third-country group.

PARAGRAPH_74237: Article 21b of Directive 2013/36/EU was introduced in the new banking package to require third- country groups with total activities in the EU above a certain threshold to establish an intermediate EU parent undertaking (IPU). According to Article 21b(1) and (4) of Directive 2013/36/EU, the threshold is set at the level of EUR 40 billion3. Therefore, third-country groups that account with two or more institutions in the Union and reach the threshold shall have an IPU.

PARAGRAPH_74238: B. Policy objective

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:18]
PARAGRAPH_74239: The guidelines aim at providing clarity on the practical application of the IPU requirement for the third-country groups as well as the competent authorities supervising their branches and subsidiaries in the EU. In particular, the guidelines provide a common methodology for the calculation of the total value of assets to be compared with the IPU threshold. Such common methodology is crucial for achieving consistent application of Union law and the application of consolidated supervision to institutions based on the same criteria.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:19]
PARAGRAPH_74254: Under this approach, the threshold is based on an average of the sum of total assets of the third- country group in the Union calculated over the twelve months of any calendar year. This approach is aligned with other existing provisions in the EU legislative framework (i.e. investment firms should be subject to the requirements of the Capital Requirements Regulation when a threshold of EUR 15 billion of the total value of consolidated assets is breached, calculated as the average of the previous 12 months5).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:19]
PARAGRAPH_74255: This approach avoids window-dressing strategies and would provide the stable level of significance of each third-country group within the EU, avoiding the impact of one-off events. However, monthly information on assets may not be available for all institutions, including investment firms, and branches of third-country groups. Therefore, more granular reporting might be required.

Moreover, the frequency of three quarters would not be aligned with other provisions of Directive 2013/36/EU related to the reporting requirements of third-country branches operating in the Union to competent authorities (i.e. Article 47 of Directive 2013/36/EU states that they should report financial information annually).

PARAGRAPH_74275: From the literal interpretation of Article 21b(8) of Directive 2013/36/EU, the threshold of EUR 40 billion shall be complied as at 27 June 2019. Thus, the total value of assets of the third-country group in the EU should be considered as a specific point in time and not as an average. On one hand, this would be the simplest and more straightforward interpretation. However, a short-term variation in assets due to market developments (or separation of assets) could entail that the obligation to establish an IPU is not justified.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:21] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_74284: Regarding competent authorities, costs are expected to arise from the implementation of reporting standards to ensure that third-country groups provide them at least on a quarterly basis with all the information necessary for the purpose of notification in accordance with Article 21b(6) of Directive 2013/36/EU: (i) names and total value of assets of institutions belonging to a third-country group, (ii) names and assets of branches authorised in the Member State, (iii) name and type of the EU parent undertaking and the third-country group of which is part. This information should be notified to the EBA at least annually.

PARAGRAPH_74285: Moreover, they have to put in place processes and resources to comply with the mandate established in Article 21b(7) of Directive 2013/36/EU, which specifies that they are responsible for ensuring that every institution that is part of a third-country group meets one of the following conditions: (i) it has or it is an intermediate EU parent undertaking, (ii) it is the only institution within the EU of the third-country group or (iii) it is part of a third-country group with a total value of assets in the EU of less than EUR 40 billion.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:21]

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:21] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_74287: Regarding firms, there are one-off costs related to the establishment of the intermediate EU parent undertaking if the threshold is met, mainly through the authorisation process already envisaged in the EU prudential framework. Other costs are expected to arise from the application of processes to calculate quarterly averages of all assets in the EU of the third-country group and report them to competent authorities.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:21] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_74288: Among the benefits for firms are the increased clarity among market participants of the background of third-country branches and subsidiaries. This benefit comes from the fact that, under Article 21b(7) of Directive 2013/36/EU, the EBA shall disclose on the website the list of all third-country groups operating in the Union and their intermediate EU parent undertaking. Therefore, market participants could have access to the identity and the financial position of the intermediate EU parent undertaking.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:21]
PARAGRAPH_74289: The benefits for the single market are related to the enhanced level playing field among financial institutions about the requirements to operate in the EU, the increased strength of the overall EU banking sector, the removal of impediments to resolvability (by avoiding transfers of funds from the parent entity) and the reduced probability of a banking crisis stemming from these entities.

PARAGRAPH_74350: Respondents in general agreed with the proposed draft guidelines but requested clarifications on several points, in particular on the scope and date of application of the requirement for the quarterly and forward-looking monitoring. Clarifications where therefore provided that while it is necessary that quarterly monitoring is performed at all times by all third-country groups operating in the Union, the forward-looking monitoring is no longer required after the IPU is set. For this purpose the date of application of these guidelines is relevant, although institutions may discuss specific application issues with their competent authorities on a case-by-case basis.

PARAGRAPH_74351: Furthermore, respondents asked about the treatment of assets in the UK in the context of this country leaving the Union after the reference date for the application of the transitional period.

PARAGRAPH_74352: Finally, respondents requested clarifications regarding the treatment of minority investments in the EU institutions and suggested that the scope of calculation of the total value of assets in the Union should be limited to the scope of consolidation of the parent company group. Such clarification was therefore reflected in the text of the guidelines by clarifying that those institutions should be taken into account which are subsidiaries of third-country groups.

However, they are not expected to be included under the scope of an IPU. While third-country branches are not included within the IPU consolidated supervision, competent authorities supervising the branches and competent authorities supervising institutions belonging to the same third-country group are expected to cooperate closely based on Article 47 CRD.

PARAGRAPH_74429: One respondent suggested limiting
reporting requirements for third-country groups that already have an IPU, even in cases where the group falls below the threshold if it is not the intention of the group to unwind the IPU.

PARAGRAPH_74430: As also explained above, quarterly monitoring and
reporting must be performed by all third-country groups to ensure an appropriate overview of the operations of these groups in the Union not only by the institutions belonging to these groups but also by their competent authorities as well as market participants. However, as specified in paragraph 16 of these guidelines, those groups which already set up an IPU and do not intend to unwind it are no longer required to perform forward-looking monitoring.

PARAGRAPH_74433: While these guidelines do not specify the necessary
technical arrangements for reporting or information exchange, the date of application of the IPU requirement is specified in the CRD, and, as such, institutions subject to this requirement must ensure that it is met in a timely manner. Any specific circumstances may be discussed by the institutions with their competent authorities on a case- by-case basis.
