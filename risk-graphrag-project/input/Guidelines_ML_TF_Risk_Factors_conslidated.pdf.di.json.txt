[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_93354: 5. These guidelines set out factors firms should consider when assessing the money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risk associated with their business, and with a business relationship or an occasional transaction with any natural or legal person ('the customer'). They also set out how firms should adjust the extent of their customer due diligence (CDD) measures in a way that is commensurate to the ML/TF risk they have identified.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_93355: 6. These guidelines' main focus is on risk assessments of individual business relationships and occasional transactions, but firms should use these guidelines mutatis mutandis when assessing ML/TF risk across their business in line with Article 8 of Directive (EU) 2015/849.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_93401: 1.2. To comply with their obligations set out in Directive (EU) 2015/849, firms should assess:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_93402: a) the ML/TF risk to which they are exposed as a result of the nature and complexity of their business (the business-wide risk assessment); and

PARAGRAPH_93403: b) the ML/TF risk to which they are exposed as a result of entering into a business relationship or carrying out an occasional transaction (individual risk assessments).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_93404: Each risk assessment should consist of two distinct but related steps:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_93405: a) the identification of ML/TF risk factors; and

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_93407: 1.3. When assessing the overall level of residual ML/TF risk associated with their business and with individual business relationships or occasional transactions, firms should consider both, the level of inherent risk, and the quality of controls and other risk mitigating factors.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_93408: 1.4. As set out in Article 8(2) of Directive (EU) 2015/849, firms should record and document their business-wide risk assessment, as well as any changes made to this risk assessment in a way that makes it possible for the firm, and for competent authorities, to understand how it was conducted, and why it was conducted in a particular way.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_93413: 1.6. Firms should put in place systems and controls to keep their assessments of the ML/TF risk associated with their business, and with their individual business relationships under review to ensure that their assessment of ML/TF risk remains up to date and relevant.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_93414: 1.7. The systems and controls that firms should put in place to ensure their individual and business-wide risk assessments remain up to date should include:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_93415: a) Setting a date for each calendar year on which the next business-wide risk assessment update will take place, and setting a date on a risk sensitive basis for the individual risk assessment to ensure new or emerging risks are included.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_93416: b) Where the firm becomes aware before that date that a new ML/TF risk has emerged, or an existing one has increased, this should be reflected in their individual and business-wide risk assessments as soon as possible; and

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:9]
PARAGRAPH_93433: 1.11. Business-wide risk assessments should help firms understand where they are exposed to ML/TF risk and which areas of their business they should prioritise in the fight against ML/TF.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:9]
PARAGRAPH_93434: 1.12. To this end, firms should take a holistic view of the ML/TF risks to which they are exposed, by identifying and assessing the ML/TF risk associated with the products and services they offer, the jurisdictions they operate in, the customers they attract and the transaction or delivery channels they use to service their customers ..

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:9]
PARAGRAPH_93435: 1.13. Firms should:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:9] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_93439: 1.14. Firms should ensure that their business-wide risk assessment is tailored to their business profile and takes into account the factors and risks specific to the firm's business, whether the firm draws up its own business-wide risk assessment or contracts an external party to draw up its business-wide risk assessment. Similarly, where a firm is part of a group that draws up a group-wide risk assessment, the firm should consider whether the group-wide risk assessment is sufficiently granular and specific to reflect the firm's business and the risks

PARAGRAPH_93441: to which it is exposed as a result of the group's links to countries and geographical areas, and complement the group-wide risk assessment if necessary. If the group is headquartered in a country associated with a high level of corruption, the firm should reflect this in its risk assessment even if the group-wide risk assessment stays silent on this point.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:10]
PARAGRAPH_93442: 1.15. A generic ML/TF risk assessment that has not been adapted to the specific needs and business model of the firm ('an off-the-shelf ML/TF risk assessment'), or a group-wide risk assessment that is applied unquestioningly, is unlikely to meet the requirements in Article 8 of Directive (EU) 2015/849.

PARAGRAPH_93444: 1.16. As set out in Article 8 of Directive (EU) 2015, 849, the steps a firm takes to identify and assess ML/TF risk across its business must be proportionate to the nature and size of each firm. Small firms that do not offer complex products or services and that have limited or purely domestic exposure, may not need a complex or sophisticated risk assessment.

PARAGRAPH_93451: 1.18. Firms should use the findings from their business-wide risk assessment to inform their AML/CFT policies, controls and procedures, as set out in Article 8(3) and (4) of Directive (EU) 2015/849. Firms should ensure that their business-wide risk assessment also reflects the steps taken to assess the ML/TF risk associated with individual business relationships or occasional transactions and their ML/TF risk appetite.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:10] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_93452: 1.19. To comply with Guideline 1.18, and also having regard to Guidelines 1.21 and 1.22, firms should use the business-wide risk assessment to inform the level of initial customer due diligence that they will apply in specific situations, and to particular types of customers, products, services and delivery channels.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:11]
PARAGRAPH_93454: 1.20. Individual risk assessments should inform, but are no substitute for, a business-wide risk assessment.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:11] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_93464: 1.25. Firms should adjust the extent of initial CDD measures on a risk-sensitive basis, taking into account the findings from their business-wide risk assessment. Where the risk associated with a business relationship is likely to be low, and to the extent permitted by national legislation, firms may be able to apply simplified customer due diligence measures (SDD). Where the risk associated with a business relationship is likely to be increased, firms must apply enhanced customer due diligence measures (EDD).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:11] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_93466: 1.26. Firms should gather sufficient information so that they are satisfied that they have identified all relevant risk factors at the beginning of the business relationship and throughout the business relationship or before carrying out the occasional transaction. Where necessary, firms should apply additional CDD measures, and assess those risk factors to obtain a holistic view of the risk associated with a particular business relationship or occasional transaction.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:12]
PARAGRAPH_93468: 1.27. There is no expectation that firms should draw up a complete customer risk profile for occasional transactions.

PARAGRAPH_93504: e) Does the customer have political connections, for example, are they a Politically Exposed Person (PEP), or is their beneficial owner a PEP? Does the customer or beneficial owner have any other relevant links to a PEP, for example are any of the customer's directors PEPs and, if so, do these PEPs exercise significant control over the customer or beneficial owner? Where a customer or their beneficial owner is a PEP, firms must always apply EDD measures in line with Article 20 of Directive (EU) 2015/849.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:14]
PARAGRAPH_93505: f) Does the customer or beneficial owner hold another prominent position or enjoy a high public profile that might enable them to abuse this position for private gain?

PARAGRAPH_93512: a) Are there adverse media reports or other relevant sources of information about the customer, for example are there any allegations of criminality or terrorism against the customer or the beneficial owner? If so, are these reliable and credible? Firms should determine the credibility of allegations on the basis of the quality and independence of the source of the data and the persistence of reporting of these allegations, among other considerations. Firms should note that the absence of criminal convictions alone may not be sufficient to dismiss allegations of wrongdoing.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:15]
PARAGRAPH_93513: b) Has the customer, beneficial owner or anyone publicly known to be closely associated with them had their assets frozen due to administrative or criminal proceedings or allegations of terrorism or terrorist financing?

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:16] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_93529: 1) Where the customer is a non-resident, could their needs be better serviced elsewhere? Is there a sound economic and lawful rationale for the customer requesting the type of financial service sought? Firms should note that Article 16 of Directive 2014/92/EU creates a right for customers who are legally resident in the Union to obtain a basic payment account, but this right applies only to the extent that credit institutions can comply with their AML/CFT obligations as referred to in Articles 1(7) and 16(4) of Directive 2014/92/EU.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:18]
PARAGRAPH_93551: 2.10. Firms should note that the nature and purpose of the business relationship, or the type of business, will often determine the relative importance of individual country and geographical risk factors. For example:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:18]
PARAGRAPH_93552: a) Where the funds used in the business relationship have been generated abroad, the level of predicate offences to money laundering and the effectiveness of a country's legal system will be particularly relevant.

PARAGRAPH_93553: b) Where funds are received from, or sent to, jurisdictions where groups committing terrorist offences are known to be operating, firms should consider to what extent this could be expected to or might give rise to suspicion, based on what the firm knows about the purpose and nature of the business relationship.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:18]
PARAGRAPH_93554: c) Where the customer is a credit or financial institution, firms should pay particular attention to the adequacy of the country's AML/CFT regime and the effectiveness of AML/CFT supervision.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:23] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_93605: iii. whether they are based in a jurisdiction associated with higher ML/TF risk. Where a third party is based in a high-risk third country that the CEU Commission has identified as having strategic deficiencies, firms must not rely on that third party. However, to the extent permitted by national legislation, reliance may be possible provided that the intermediary is a branch or majority-owned subsidiary of another firm established in the Union, and the firm is confident that the intermediary fully complies with group-wide policies and procedures in line with Article 45 of Directive (EU) 2015/849.6

PARAGRAPH_93619: 3.2. Firms should take a holistic view of the ML/TF risk factors they have identified that, together, will determine the level of ML/TF risk associated with a business relationship, an occasional transaction, or their business.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:24]
PARAGRAPH_93620: 3.3. Firms should note that, unless Directive (EU) 2015/849 or national legislation states otherwise, the presence of isolated risk factors does not necessarily move a relationship into a higher or lower risk category.

PARAGRAPH_93621: Weighting risk factors

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:24]
PARAGRAPH_93622: 3.4. When assessing ML/TF risk, firms may decide to weight factors differently depending on their relative importance.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:24]
PARAGRAPH_93623: 3.5. When weighting risk factors, firms should make an informed judgement about the relevance of different risk factors in the context of a business relationship, an occasional transaction or their business. This often results in firms allocating different 'scores' to different factors; for example, firms may decide that a customer's personal links to a jurisdiction associated with higher ML/TF risk is less relevant in light of the features of the product they seek.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:24] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_93624: 3.6. Ultimately, the weight given to each of these factors is likely to vary from product to product and customer to customer (or category of customer) and from one firm to another. When weighting risk factors, firms should ensure that:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:24]
PARAGRAPH_93625: a) weighting is not unduly influenced by just one factor;

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:24]
PARAGRAPH_93626: b) economic or profit considerations do not influence the risk rating;

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:24]
PARAGRAPH_93627: c) weighting does not lead to a situation where it is impossible for any business relationship to be classified as high risk;

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:24]
PARAGRAPH_93628: d) the provisions of Directive (EU) 2015/849 or national legislation regarding situations that always present a high money laundering risk cannot be over- ruled by the firm's weighting; and

PARAGRAPH_93631: 3.7. Where a firm uses automated IT systems to allocate overall risk scores to categorise business relationships or occasional transactions and does not develop these in house but purchases them from an external provider, it should understand how the system works and how it combines or weights risk factors to achieve an overall risk score. A firm must always be able to satisfy itself that the scores allocated reflect the firm's understanding of ML/TF risk and it should be able to demonstrate this to the competent authority.

PARAGRAPH_93632: Categorising risk

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:25]
PARAGRAPH_93633: 3.8. Firms should decide on the most appropriate way to categorise risk. This will depend on the nature and size of the firm's business and the types of ML/TF risk it is exposed to. Although firms often categorise risk as high, medium and low, other categorisations are possible.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:25]
PARAGRAPH_93634: 3.9.

Firms should note that the monetary threshold in Article 11 (b) of Directive (EU) 2015/847 is relevant only to the extent that it triggers an absolute requirement to apply CDD measures; a series of occasional transactions can be a business relationship even where that threshold is not reached;

PARAGRAPH_93667: Beneficial ownership registers

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:28]
PARAGRAPH_93669: 4.13. Firms should be mindful that using information contained in beneficial ownership registers does not, in itself, fulfil their duty to take adequate and risk-sensitive measures to identity the beneficial owner and verify their identity. Firms may have to take additional steps to identify and verify the beneficial owner, in particular where the risk associated with the business relationship is increased or where the firm has doubts that the person listed in the register is the ultimate beneficial owner.

PARAGRAPH_93670: Control through other means

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:28] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_93671: 4.14. The requirement to identify, and take all necessary and reasonable measures to verify the identity of the beneficial owner relates only to the natural person who ultimately owns or controls the customer. However, to comply with their obligations under Article 13 of Directive (EU) 2015/849, firms should also take reasonable measures to understand the customer's ownership and control structure.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:28]
PARAGRAPH_93672: 4.15. The measures firms take to understand the customer's ownership and control structure should be sufficient so that the firm can be reasonably satisfied that it understands the risk associated with different layers of ownership and control. In particular, firms should be satisfied that,

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:28]
PARAGRAPH_93673: a) the customer's ownership and control structure is not unduly complex or opaque; or

PARAGRAPH_93674: b) complex or opaque ownership and control structures have a legitimate legal or economic reason.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:28] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_93675: 4.16. To meet their obligations under Article 33 (1) of Directive (EU) 2015/849, firms should report to the FIU if the customer's ownership and control structure give rise to suspicion and they have reasonable grounds to suspect that the funds may be the proceeds of criminal activity or are related to terrorist financing.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:28]
PARAGRAPH_93676: 4.17. Firms should pay particular attention to persons who may exercise 'control through other means' under Article 3(6) (a)(i) of Directive (EU) 2015/849. Examples of 'control through other means' firms should consider include, but are not limited to:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:28]
PARAGRAPH_93677: a) control without direct ownership, for example through close family relationships, or historical or contractual associations;

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29]
PARAGRAPH_93683: 4.19. Where the customer is a legal entity, firms should make every effort to identify the beneficial owner as defined in Article 3(6)(a) (i) of Directive (EU) 2015/849.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29]
PARAGRAPH_93684: 4.20. Firms should resort to identifying the customer's senior managing officials as beneficial owners only if:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29]
PARAGRAPH_93685: a) They have exhausted all possible means of identifying the natural person who ultimately owns or controls the customer;

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29]
PARAGRAPH_93686: b) Their inability to identify the natural person who ultimately owns or controls the customer does not give rise to suspicions of ML/TF; and

PARAGRAPH_93687: c) They are satisfied that the reason given by the customer as to why the natural person who ultimately owns or controls the customer cannot be identified is plausible.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29]
PARAGRAPH_93688: 4.21. When deciding which senior managing official, or which senior managing officials, to identify as beneficial owner, firms should consider who has ultimate and overall responsibility for the customer and takes binding decisions on the customer's behalf.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_93689: 4.22. In those cases, firms should clearly document their reasons for identifying the senior manager, rather than the customer's beneficial owner, and must keep records of their actions7.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29]
PARAGRAPH_93691: 4.23. Where the customer is a public administration or a state-owned enterprise, firms should follow the guidance in guidelines 4.21 and 4.22 to identify the senior managing official.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_93692: 4.24. In those cases, and in particular where the risk associated with the relationship is increased, for example because the state-owned enterprise is from a country associated with high levels of corruption, firms should take risk-sensitive steps to establish that the person they have identified as the beneficial owner is properly authorised by the customer to act on the customer's behalf.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_93693: 4.25. Firms should also have due regard to the possibility that the senior managing official of the customer may be a PEP. Should this be the case, firms must apply EDD measures to that senior managing official in line with Article 18 of Directive (EU) 2015/849, and assess whether the extent to which the PEP can influence the customer gives rise to increased ML/TF risk and whether it may be necessary to apply EDD measures to the customer.

PARAGRAPH_93697: 4.26. To comply with their obligations under Article 13(1)(a) and (b) of Directive (EU) 2015/849, firms should verify their customer's identity and, where applicable, beneficial owners' identity, on the basis of reliable and independent information and data, whether this is obtained remotely, electronically or in documentary form.

PARAGRAPH_93713: b) assess whether the non-face to face nature of the relationship or occasional transaction gives rise to increased ML/TF risk and if so, adjust their CDD measures accordingly. When assessing the risk associated with non-face to face relationships, firms should have regard to the risk factors set out in Guideline 2.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:31]
PARAGRAPH_93714: 4.30. Where the risk associated with a non-face to face relationship or an occasional transaction is increased, firms should apply EDD measures in line with Guidelines 4.46. Firms should consider in particular whether enhanced measures to verify the identity of the customer or enhanced ongoing monitoring of the relationship would be appropriate.

In those situations, firms may not need to re-apply all CDD measures, but should determine which CDD measures to apply, and the extent of the CDD measures they will apply. For example, in lower risk cases, firms may be able to draw on information obtained in the course of the business relationship to update the CDD information they hold on the customer.

This assessment should be documented appropriately. In line with the risk-based approach, where the risk is especially high and in particular where the volume of correspondent banking transactions is substantive, the correspondent should consider on-site visits and/or sample testing to be satisfied that the respondent's AML policies and procedures are implemented effectively.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:55]
PARAGRAPH_94006: 9.1. For the purpose of these guidelines, retail banking means the provision of banking services to natural persons and small and medium-sized enterprises. Examples of retail banking products and services include current accounts, mortgages, savings accounts, consumer and term loans, and credit lines.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:55]
PARAGRAPH_94007: 9.2. Owing to the nature of the products and services offered, the relative ease of access and the often large volume of transactions and business relationships, retail banking is vulnerable to terrorist financing and to all stages of the money laundering process. At the same time, the volume of business relationships and transactions associated with retail banking can make identifying ML/TF risk associated with individual relationships and spotting suspicious transactions particularly challenging.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:55]
PARAGRAPH_94008: 9.3. Banks should consider the following risk factors and measures alongside those set out in Title I of these guidelines. Banks that provide payment initiation services or account information services should also refer to the sectoral guideline 18.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:57] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_94038: vi. The customer is a non-resident. Banks should note that Article 16 of Directive 2014/92/EU creates a right for consumers who are legally resident in the European Union to obtain a basic bank account, although the right to open and use a basic payment account applies only to the extent that banks can comply with their AML/CFT obligations and does not exempt banks from their obligation to identify and assess ML/TF risk, including the risk associated with the customer not being a resident of the Member State in which the bank is based. 15

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:57]
PARAGRAPH_94039: vii. The customer's beneficial owner cannot easily be identified, for example because the customer's ownership structure is unusual, unduly complex or opaque, or because the customer issues bearer shares.

PARAGRAPH_94043: iii. The customer's behaviour or transaction volume is not in line with that expected from the category of customer to which they belong, or is unexpected based on the information the customer provided at account opening.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:57]
PARAGRAPH_94044: iv. The customer's behaviour is unusual, for example the customer unexpectedly and without reasonable explanation accelerates an agreed repayment schedule, by means either of lump sum repayments or early termination; deposits or demands payout of high-value bank notes without apparent reason; increases activity after a period of dormancy; or makes transactions that appear to have no economic rationale.

PARAGRAPH_94218: Guideline 11: Sectoral guideline for money remitters

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:71]
PARAGRAPH_94219: 11.1. Money remitters are payment institutions or e-money institutions or credit institutions that have been authorised in line with Directive (EU) 2015/2366 to provide and execute payment services throughout the EU. The businesses in this sector are diverse and range from individual businesses to complex chain operators.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:71]
PARAGRAPH_94220: 11.2. Many money remitters use agents to provide payment services on their behalf. Agents often provide payment services as an ancillary component to their main business and they may not themselves be obliged entities under applicable AML/CFT legislation; accordingly, their AML/CFT expertise may be limited.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:71]
PARAGRAPH_94221: 11.3. The nature of the service provided can expose money remitters to ML/TF risk. This is due to the simplicity and speed of transactions, their worldwide reach and their often cash- based character. Furthermore, the nature of this payment service means that money remitters often carry out occasional transactions rather than establishing a business relationship with their customers, which means that their understanding of the ML/TF risk associated with the customer may be limited.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:71]
PARAGRAPH_94222: 11.4. Money remitters should consider the following risk factors and measures alongside those set out in Title I of these guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:72]
PARAGRAPH_94241: ii. The customer appears to be acting for someone else, for example others watch over the customer or are visible outside the place where the transaction is made, or the customer reads instructions from a note.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:72]
PARAGRAPH_94242: iii. The customer's behaviour makes no apparent economic sense, for example the customer accepts a poor exchange rate or high charges unquestioningly, requests a transaction in a currency that is not official tender or commonly used in the jurisdiction where the customer and/or recipient is located or requests or provides large amounts of currency in either low or high denominations.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:72]

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:74]
PARAGRAPH_94275: a) The payer or the payee is located , or the transaction is executed from an IP address, in a jurisdiction associated with higher ML/TF risk. Firms should pay particular attention to jurisdictions known to provide funding or support for terrorist activities or where groups committing terrorist offences are known to be operating, and jurisdictions subject to financial sanctions, embargoes or measures that are related to terrorism, financing of terrorism or proliferation.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:74]
PARAGRAPH_94276: b) The payee is resident in a jurisdiction that has no, or a less developed, formal banking sector, which means that informal money remittance services, such as hawala, may be used at point of payment.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:75] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_94281: 11.12.Since many money remitters' business is primarily transaction-based, firms should consider which monitoring systems and controls they put in place to ensure that they detect money-laundering and terrorist financing attempts even where the CDD information they hold on the customer is basic or missing because no business relationship has been established. When analysing appropriate monitoring systems, money remitters should ensure that are aligned with the size and complexity of the business and their transaction volume.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:75]
PARAGRAPH_94282: 11.13. Firms should in any case put in place:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:75]
PARAGRAPH_94283: a) systems to identify linked transactions, including those that might amount to a business relationship according to their policies and procedures, such as systems to identify series of transactions bellow EUR 1 000 which have the same payer and payee and an element of duration;

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:75]
PARAGRAPH_94289: 11.14. Where the risk associated with an occasional transaction or business relationship is increased, firms should apply EDD in line with Title I, including, where appropriate, increased transaction monitoring (e.g. increased frequency or lower thresholds). Conversely, where the risk associated with an occasional transaction or business relationship is low and to the extent permitted by national legislation, firms may be able to apply SDD measures in line with Title I.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:76] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_94293: 11.16.Money remitters using agents to provide payment services should know who their agents as set out in Article 19 of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 are. As part of this, money remitters should establish and maintain appropriate and risk- sensitive policies and procedures to counter the risk that their agents may engage in, or be used for, ML/TF, including by:

PARAGRAPH_94296: c) Taking reasonable measures to satisfy themselves that the agent's AML/CFT internal controls are appropriate and remain appropriate throughout the agency relationship, for example by monitoring a sample of the agent's transactions or reviewing the agent's controls on site. Where an agent's internal AML/CFT controls differ from the money remitter's, for example because the agent represents more than one principal or because the agent is itself an obliged entity under applicable AML/CFT legislation, the money remitter should assess and manage the risk that these differences might affect its own, and the agent's, AML/CFT compliance.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:76] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_94297: d) Providing AML/CFT training to agents to ensure that agents have an adequate understanding of relevant ML/TF risks and the quality of the AML/CFT controls the money remitter expects.

PARAGRAPH_94299: Guideline 12: Sectoral guideline for wealth management

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:77]
PARAGRAPH_94300: 12.1. Wealth management is the provision of banking and other financial services to high-net- worth individuals and their families or businesses. It is also known as private banking. Clients of wealth management firms can expect dedicated relationship management staff to provide tailored services covering, for example, banking (e.g. current accounts, mortgages and foreign exchange), investment management and advice, fiduciary services, safe custody, insurance, family office services, tax and estate planning and associated facilities, including legal support.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:77]
PARAGRAPH_94301: 12.2. Many of the features typically associated with wealth management, such as wealthy and influential clients; very high-value transactions and portfolios; complex products and services, including tailored investment products; and an expectation of confidentiality and discretion are indicative of a higher risk for money laundering relative to those typically present in retail banking. Wealth management firms' services may be particularly vulnerable to abuse by clients who wish to conceal the origins of their funds or, for example, evade tax in their home jurisdiction.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:77]
PARAGRAPH_94302: 12.3. Firms in this sector should consider the following risk factors and measures alongside those set out in Title I of these guidelines. The sectoral guidelines 9, 14 and 17 in Title I, may also be relevant in this context.

PARAGRAPH_94313: g) cross-border arrangements where assets are deposited or managed in another financial institution, either of the same financial group or outside the group, particularly where the other financial institution is based in a jurisdiction associated with higher ML/TF risk.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:79]
PARAGRAPH_94328: 12.7. The staff member managing a wealth management firm's relationship with a customer (the relationship manager) typically plays a key role in assessing risk. The relationship manager's close contact with the customer will facilitate the collection of information that allows a fuller picture of the purpose and nature of the customer's business to be formed (e.g. an understanding of the client's source of wealth, the destination of funds, why complex or unusual arrangements may nonetheless be genuine and legitimate, or why extra security may be appropriate). This close contact may, however, also lead to conflicts of interest if the relationship manager becomes too close to the customer, to the detriment of the firm's efforts to manage the risk of financial crime. Consequently, independent oversight of risk assessment will also be appropriate, provided by, for example, the compliance department and senior management.

PARAGRAPH_94331: a) Obtaining and verifying more information about clients than in standard risk situations and reviewing and updating this information both on a regular basis and when prompted by material changes to a client's profile.

PARAGRAPH_94345: 13.1. Trade finance means managing a payment to facilitate the movement of goods (and the provision of services) either domestically or across borders. When goods are shipped internationally, the importer faces the risk that the goods will not arrive; while the exporter may be concerned, that payment will not be forthcoming. To lessen these dangers, many trade finance instruments therefore place banks in the middle of the transaction.

PARAGRAPH_94347: a) 'Open account' transactions: these are transactions where the buyer makes a payment once they have received the goods. These are the most common means of financing trade, but the underlying trade-related nature of the transaction will often not be known to the banks executing the fund transfer. Banks should refer to the guidance in Title I to manage the risk associated with such transactions.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:81]
PARAGRAPH_94348: b) Documentary letters of credit (LCs) that have many variations and are suited to a different situation respectively: an LC is a financial instrument issued by a bank that guarantees payment to a named beneficiary (typically an exporter) upon presentation of certain 'complying' documents specified in the credit terms (e.g. evidence that goods have been dispatched).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:81]
PARAGRAPH_94349: c) Documentary bills for collection (BCs): a BC refers to a process by which payment, or an accepted draft, is collected by a 'collecting' bank from an importer of goods for onward payment to the exporter. The collecting bank gives the relevant trade documentation (which will have been received from the exporter, normally through their bank) to the importer in return.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:81]
PARAGRAPH_94350: 13.3. Other trade finance products such as forfaiting or structured financing, or wider activity such as project finance, are outside the scope of these sectoral guidelines. Banks offering these products should refer to the general guidance in Title I.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:81]
PARAGRAPH_94351: 13.4. Trade finance products can be abused for money laundering and terrorist financing purposes. For example, the buyer and seller may collude to misrepresent the price, type, quality or quantity of goods in order to transfer funds or value between countries.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:81] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_94352: 13.5. Banks should take into account that the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) has developed standards such as the Uniform Customs & Practice for Documentary Credits (600) that is a set of rules which apply to finance institutions which issue Letters of Credit that govern the use of LCs and BCs, but that these do not cover matters related to financial crime. Banks should note that these standards do not have legal force and their use does not mean that banks do not need to comply with their legal and regulatory AML/CFT obligations.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:82]
PARAGRAPH_94354: 13.6. Firms in this sector should consider the following risk factors and measures alongside those set out in Title I of these guidelines. The sectoral guideline 8 in Title II may also be relevant in this context.

PARAGRAPH_94355: Risk factors

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:82]
PARAGRAPH_94356: 13.7. Banks that are party to trade finance transactions often have access only to partial information about the transaction and the parties to it. Trade documentation can be diverse, and banks may not have expert knowledge of the different types of trade documentation they receive. This can make the identification and assessment of ML/TF risk challenging.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:82] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_94357: 13.8. Banks should, nevertheless, use common sense and professional judgement to assess the extent to which the information and documentation they have could give rise to concern or suspicion of ML/TF.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:82]
PARAGRAPH_94358: 13.9. To the extent possible, banks should consider the following risk factors:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:82]
PARAGRAPH_94364: d) There are significant discrepancies in documentation, for example between the description of the type, quantity or quality of goods in key documents (i.e. invoices, insurance and transport documents) and actual goods shipped, to the extent that this is known.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:82]
PARAGRAPH_94365: e) The type, quantity and value of goods is inconsistent with the bank's knowledge of the buyer's business.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:82]
PARAGRAPH_94366: f) The goods transacted are higher risk for money-laundering purposes, for example certain commodities the prices of which can fluctuate significantly, which can make bogus prices difficult to detect.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:82]
PARAGRAPH_94367: g) The agreed value of goods or shipment is over- or under-insured or multiple insurances are used, to the extent this is known.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:83]
PARAGRAPH_94369: h) The goods transacted require export licenses, such as specific export authorizations for dual-use items that are goods, software and technology that can be used for both civilian and military applications.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:83] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_94370: i) The trade documentation does not comply with applicable laws or standards.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:83]
PARAGRAPH_94371: j) Unit pricing appears unusual, based on what the bank knows about the goods and trade.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:83]
PARAGRAPH_94372: k) The transaction is otherwise unusual, for example LCs are frequently amended without a clear rationale or goods are shipped through another jurisdiction for no apparent commercial reason.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:83] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_94373: I) The goods traded are destined to a party or country that is subject to a sanction, an embargo or a similar measure issued by, for example, the Union or the United Nations, or in support of such party or country.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:83]

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:83]
PARAGRAPH_94378: 13.12. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:83]
PARAGRAPH_94379: a) The transaction and/or the parties involved are out of line with what the bank knows about the customer's previous activity or line of business (e.g. the goods being shipped, or the shipping volumes, are inconsistent with what is known about the importer or exporter's business).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:83]
PARAGRAPH_94380: b) There are indications that the buyer and seller may be colluding, for example:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:83]

PARAGRAPH_94390: Country or geographical risk factors

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:84]
PARAGRAPH_94391: 13.14. The following factors may contribute to increasing risk:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:84]
PARAGRAPH_94392: a) A country associated with the transaction (including the country from which the goods originated, for which they are destined or transited through, or where either party to the transaction is based) has no currency exchange controls in place. This increases the risk that the transaction's true purpose is to export currency in contravention of local law.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:84]
PARAGRAPH_94393: b) A country associated with the transaction has higher levels of predicate offences (e.g. those related to the narcotics trade, smuggling or counterfeiting) or free trade zones.

PARAGRAPH_94399: 13.16.Banks must carry out CDD on the instructing party. In practice, most banks will only accept instructions from existing customers and the wider business relationship that the bank has with the customer may assist its due diligence efforts.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:85]
PARAGRAPH_94401: 13.17.Where a bank provides trade finance services to a customer, it should take steps, as part of its CDD process, to understand its customer's business . Examples of the type of information the bank could obtain include the countries with which the customer trades, the trading routes used, goods traded, who the customer does business with (buyers, suppliers, etc.), whether the customer uses agents or third parties, and, if so, where these are based. This should help banks understand who the customer is and aid the detection of unusual or suspicious transactions.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:85] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_94405: 13.20.In other higher risk situations, banks must also apply EDD. As part of this, banks should consider whether performing more thorough due diligence checks on the transaction itself and on other parties to the transaction (including non-customers) would be appropriate.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:85]
PARAGRAPH_94406: 13.21.Checks on other parties to the transaction may include:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:85]

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:85]
PARAGRAPH_94410: a) using third party or open source data sources, for example the International Maritime Bureau (for warning notices, bills of lading, shipping and pricing checks) or shipping lines' free container tracking service to verify the information provided and to check that the purpose of the transaction is legitimate;

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:85]
PARAGRAPH_94411: b) using professional judgement to consider whether the pricing of goods makes commercial sense, in particular in relation to traded commodities for which reliable and up-to-date pricing information can be obtained;

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:85]

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:86] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_94414: 13.23.Since LCs and BCs are largely paper-based and accompanied by trade-related documents (e.g. invoices, bills of lading and manifests), automated transaction monitoring may not be feasible. The processing bank should assess these documents for consistency with the terms of the trade transaction and require staff to use professional expertise and judgement to consider whether any unusual features warrant the application of EDD measures or give rise to suspicion of ML/TF.

PARAGRAPH_94418: Guideline 14: Sectoral guideline for life insurance undertakings

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:87]
PARAGRAPH_94419: 14.1. Life insurance products are designed to financially protect the policy holder against the risk of an uncertain future event, such as death, illness or outliving savings in retirement (longevity risk). Protection is achieved by an insurer who pools the financial risks that many different policy holders are faced with. Life insurance products can also be bought as investment products or for pension purposes.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:87]
PARAGRAPH_94420: 14.2. Life insurance products are provided through different distribution channels to customers who may be natural or legal persons or legal arrangements. The beneficiary of the contract may be the policy holder or a nominated or designated third party; the beneficiary may also change during the term and the original beneficiary may never benefit.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:87]
PARAGRAPH_94421: 14.3. Most life insurance products are designed for the long term and some will only pay out on a verifiable event, such as death or retirement. This means that many life insurance products are not sufficiently flexible to be the first vehicle of choice for money launderers. However, as with other financial services products, there is a risk that the funds used to purchase life insurance may be the proceeds of crime.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:87]
PARAGRAPH_94422: 14.4. Firms in this sector should consider the following risk factors and measures alongside those set out in Title I of these guidelines. The sectoral guidelines 12 and 16 in Title II may also be relevant in this context. Where intermediaries are used, the delivery channel risk factors set out in Title I will be relevant.

The provision of investment funds can involve multiple parties, such as the fund manager, appointed advisers, the depositary and sub-custodians, registrars and, in some cases, prime brokers. Similarly, the distribution of these funds can involve parties such as tied agents, advisory and discretionary wealth managers, platform service providers and independent financial advisers.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:99]
PARAGRAPH_94599: 16.2. The type and number of parties involved in the fund's distribution process depends on the nature of the fund and may affect how much the fund knows about its customer and investors. The fund or, where the fund is not itself an obliged entity, the fund manager will retain responsibility for compliance with AML/CFT obligations, although aspects of the fund's CDD obligations may be carried out by one or more of these other parties subject to certain conditions.

PARAGRAPH_94600: 16.3. Investment funds may be used by persons or entities for ML/TF purposes:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:99]
PARAGRAPH_94601: a) Retail funds are often distributed on a non-face-to-face basis; access to such funds is often easy and relatively quick to achieve, and holdings in such funds can be transferred between different parties.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:99]
PARAGRAPH_94602: b) Alterative investment funds, such as hedge funds, real estate and private equity funds, tend to have a smaller number of investors, which can be private individuals as well as institutional investors (pension funds, funds of funds). Such funds that are designed for a limited number of high-net-worth individuals, or for family offices, can have an inherently higher risk of abuse for ML/TF purposes than retail funds, since investors are more likely to be in a position to exercise control over the fund assets. If investors exercise control over the assets, such funds are personal asset-holding vehicles, which are mentioned as a factor indicating potentially higher risk in Annex III to Directive (EU) 2015/849.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:99]
PARAGRAPH_94603: c) Notwithstanding the often medium- to long-term nature of the investment, which can contribute to limiting the attractiveness of these products for money laundering purposes, they may still appeal to money launderers on the basis of their ability to generate growth and income.

PARAGRAPH_94648: 16.13. The measures funds or fund managers should take to comply with their CDD obligations will depend on how the customer or the investor (where the investor is not the customer) comes to the fund. The fund or fund manager should also take risk-sensitive measures to identify and verify the identity of the natural persons, if any, who ultimately own or control the customer (or on whose behalf the transaction is being conducted), for example by asking the prospective customer to declare, when they first apply to join the fund, whether they are investing on their own behalf or whether they are an intermediary investing on someone else's behalf.
