[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_69876: Institutions have to apply sound remuneration policies to all staff and specific requirements for the variable remuneration of staff whose professional activities have a material impact on the institutions' risk profile (identified staff). Articles 74 and 75 of Directive 2013/36/EU (CRD) mandate the EBA to develop guidelines on both, remuneration policies for all staff as part of institutions' internal governance arrangements and remuneration policies for identified staff. Remuneration policies must be gender neutral and respect the principle of equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_69877: The EBA published guidelines on remuneration policies in 2015, which have now been updated to accommodate the changes to CRD that have been introduced by Directive 2019/878/EU.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_69878: In line with Article 92(2) CRD, the specific requirements for the variable remuneration of identified staff should be applied in a manner that is appropriate to the institutions' size, internal organisation and the nature, scope and complexity of their activities. As recommended by the EBA, the co- legislators have introduced the possibility to waive some of the requirements for institutions that are not large institutions and that have total assets below a threshold set by the Member State in national law of up to EUR 15 billion and for staff that receive a low level of variable remuneration of up to EUR 50 000, namely the requirement to pay out a part of variable remuneration deferred and in instruments. In accordance with Article 94(7) CRD, the guidelines provide further details on this particular aspect.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_69879: The guidelines are addressed to institutions and competent authorities. For institutions, the guidelines apply on an individual, consolidated or sub-consolidated basis, with some exceptions for financial institutions that are subject to a specific remuneration regime, e.g. investment firms. Most investment firms are no longer subject to the respective provisions under Directive 2013/36/EU, neither on an individual basis nor to the consolidated application of the requirements under Articles 92, 94 and 95 of Directive 2013/36/EU, including the limitation of the ratio between variable and fixed remuneration (bonus cap) to 100% (200% with shareholder's approval). The guidelines also provide details on the application of the requirements in a group context and in particular regarding the application in subsidiaries that are not subject to the CRD themselves.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_69880: Parts of the guidelines concern sound and gender-neutral remuneration policies for all staff; other parts of the guidelines focus on the specific provisions that apply to institutions' remuneration policies for identified staff. In particular for identified staff, the alignment of remuneration incentives with the institutions' risk profile is crucial.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_69881: The guidelines specify in detail the requirements within Directive 2013/36/EU on remuneration policies, the respective governance arrangements and processes that should be applied when remuneration policies are implemented. The guidelines on severance pay, retention bonuses and discretionary pension benefits have been clarified to avoid such payments being used to circumvent remuneration requirements.

PARAGRAPH_69885: Background and rationale

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_69886: 1.Inappropriate remuneration structures have been a contributing factor to excessive and imprudent risk taking. Poorly designed remuneration policies have potentially detrimental effects on the sound management of risks, control of risk and the risk taking behaviour of individuals. The current remuneration requirements are set by Directive 2013/36/EU (CRD), which came into effect on 1 January 2014. The CRD has been amended by Directive (EU) 2019/8781; the amendments are to be implemented by Member States by 28 December 2020.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_69887: 2. The remuneration requirements aim to ensure that remuneration policies are consistent with and promote sound and effective risk management, do not provide incentives for excessive risk taking, and are aligned with the long-term interests of the institutions across the EU.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_69888: 3.To ensure a more proportionate approach, the co-legislator introduced in Article 94(3) the possibility to waive the pay out in instruments and the deferral of variable remuneration. When applied to smaller institutions, those requirements are too burdensome and the cost is not commensurate with the prudential benefits. Similarly, this is the case for staff with low levels of variable remuneration. While those waivers are based on thresholds provided within the amended CRD, Member States have some flexibility in their implementation and the EBA has the power to issue guidelines under Article 94(7) of the CRD to facilitate them in this regard.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_69889: 4.To reduce the costs for the application of the requirement for listed institutions to pay out remuneration in shares, the co-legislators also introduced for those listed institutions the possibility of using share-linked instruments.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_69890: 5. The new provisions introduced by Directive 2019/878/EU reinforce the principle of equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value which is laid down in Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Institutions should operate a gender-neutral remuneration policy. In accordance with Article 74(3) of the CRD, the EBA shall issue guidelines, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, on gender- neutral remuneration policies for institutions.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_69891: 6.The framework for applying remuneration provisions in a group context has also been amended. Subsidiaries that are not institutions, and therefore not subject to the CRD on an individual basis, might be subject to other specific remuneration requirements pursuant to the relevant sector- specific legal acts and if this is the case, such specific requirements should prevail. In principle, remuneration requirements set out in this Directive should therefore not apply on a consolidated basis to such subsidiaries, including financial institutions that are subject to the MiFID, IFD, AIFMD or UCITS Directive, unless Member States make use of their discretion to

PARAGRAPH_69898: 7.The guidelines are based on Article 16 of EBA founding Regulation 1093/2010, Articles 74 and 75 of the CRD. The guidelines apply on an individual, sub-consolidated and consolidated basis. However, most investment firms will in June 2021, following the implementation into national law of Directive 2019/34/EU (IFD), be subject to a specific remuneration framework for investment firms and the already applicable remuneration framework under MiFID and are therefore no longer subject to the application of Directive 2013/36/EU on an individual basis, nor to the consolidated application of the requirements under Articles 92, 94 and 95 of Directive 2013/36/EU, including the limitation of the ratio between variable and fixed remuneration to 100% (200% with shareholder's approval), unless Member States make use of the national discretion within Article 109(6) of Directive 2013/36/EU.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_69899: 8.Article 74 of the CRD requires that institutions have robust governance arrangements and remuneration policies and practices that are gender neutral and that are consistent with and promote sound and effective risk management. The EBA has been mandated to issue guidelines, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, on those arrangements, processes and mechanisms and to issue guidelines on gender-neutral remuneration policies.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_69900: 9.Furthermore, the EBA has been mandated within two years of the date of publication of the guidelines on gender-neutral remuneration policies to issue a report on the application of gender-neutral remuneration policies by institutions.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_69901: 10.Article 75 of the CRD mandates the EBA to develop guidelines with respect to requirements contained in Articles 92 to 95 of the CRD.

PARAGRAPH_69911: 14.The guidelines differentiate between the provisions applicable to all staff and provisions applicable to identified staff. As identified staff have a material impact on the risk profile, it is appropriate that more stringent remuneration policies are applied.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8] [RISK:LIQUIDITY_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_69912: 15.The gender-neutral remuneration policy for all staff, including identified staff, must be consistent with and promote sound and effective risk management. The remuneration policy should be consistent with the long-term strategy of the institution including the overall business strategy, the corresponding risk strategy and appetite, including all risk types (e.g. credit, market, operational, liquidity, reputational and other risks). To be sound and effective, risk management must be in line with the respective regulatory requirements, including Articles 74 to 87 of the CRD, the requirements on governance in Articles 88 to 91 of the CRD, the EBA guidelines on internal governance, the requirements on the internal capital adequacy assessment process and the requirements of CRR for specific risk categories, including the respective risk measurement approaches.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_69913: 16.To set the appropriate incentives for long-term oriented and prudent risk taking, the remuneration policy and practices need to be transparent for staff regarding the fixed remuneration, the variable remuneration and the award criteria used. Fixed remuneration should be permanent, predetermined, non-discretionary and non-revocable. Variable remuneration should be based on performance and in exceptional cases other conditions. Opaque remuneration policies, e.g. where the conditions for payments are not transparent, are discretionary or where adjustments of the remuneration depend unilaterally on the sole discretion of the institution, could have unforeseen effects on staff's behaviour in terms of risk- related decisions and are therefore not consistent with the above principles.

Also business units need to be involved in the development of the remuneration policy to ensure that appropriate incentives, in particular for identified staff within the business units, are set. It is important that the remuneration policy is considered in the capital and liquidity planning so that it can contribute to safeguarding a sound capital base and does not lead to shortcomings in the institutions' liquidity.

PARAGRAPH_69919: 18.The corporate bodies which have the competencies to approve the remuneration policy may differ among countries due to national corporate law. Additionally, in some countries the corporate body that approves the remuneration policy of the management body may differ from the one that approves the remuneration policy for identified staff in business areas and identified staff in control functions. For these reasons, these guidelines should be read together with the relevant national legal provisions.

PARAGRAPH_69920: 19.The body that performs the responsibilities of the management body in its supervisory function may differ among countries due to national corporate law. The EBA is aware that within Member States usually one of two governance structures is used, a unitary or a dual board structure; no particular structure is advocated. Regarding these issues, the EBA guidelines on internal governance should be taken into account.

PARAGRAPH_69921: 20.In accordance with the CRD, institutions have to apply the remuneration requirements at group, parent and subsidiary levels, including within subsidiaries that are not themselves subject to the CRD, unless they are themselves subject to specific remuneration requirements on an individual basis under other Union acts or would be subject to such requirements if they were established in the Union. However, under Article 109(5) of the CRD, the remuneration provisions may still apply to individual staff members of certain subsidiaries. As a general principle and taking into account applicable specific remuneration requirements, remuneration policies of different group entities within the scope of prudential consolidation should be consistent with the group's remuneration policy set by the consolidating institution. The remuneration policy needs to comply with the CRD provisions, these guidelines and additional requirements set within national company, labour and other relevant laws.

PARAGRAPH_69928: 22. The principle of equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value is laid down in Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The CRD requires institutions to ensure that they apply a gender-neutral remuneration policy for all staff, including their risk takers, i.e. a remuneration policy based on equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value. The same principle applies to workers of all diverse genders when implemented into national law.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:10] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_69929: 23.According to Article 157 of the TFEU, equal pay for equal work or work of equal value includes the ordinary basic or minimum wage or salary and any other consideration, whether in cash or in kind, which the worker receives directly or indirectly, in respect of their employment, from their employer. The TFEU calls for further measures to ensure equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation. However, the principle of equal treatment shall not prevent Member States from maintaining or adopting measures providing for specific advantages in order to make it easier for the underrepresented sex 2 to pursue a vocational activity or to prevent or compensate for disadvantages in professional careers.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:10] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_69930: 24.Where the remuneration of most of the staff is subject to collective bargaining, where such contracts are applicable independent of the gender of staff, it is easier to monitor that remuneration policies are applied in a gender-neutral way. Ensuring gender neutrality with regard to individually agreed contracts is more complex and requires a more sophisticated approach.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:10]
PARAGRAPH_69931: 25.Member States and employers, in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, should strive to avoid any discrimination within the conditions of employment, including discrimination based on gender.

PARAGRAPH_69932: 26.Consequently, in addition to ensuring equal pay for the same position or positions of equal value, it is also necessary to ensure equal opportunities for all genders. Equal career prospects help to improve the representation of the underrepresented gender in the management body of institutions in the longer run, by facilitating the existence of a diverse pool of candidates for such positions, e.g. within institutions' senior management.

PARAGRAPH_69940: 28.When complying with the CRD and CRR remuneration provisions, institutions should apply them in a manner that is appropriate to the institutions' size, internal organisation and the nature, scope and complexity of their activities. This proportionality principle aims to match remuneration policies and practices consistently with the institutions' risk profile, risk appetite and strategy, so that the objectives of the obligations are more efficiently achieved.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:11] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_69941: 29.Institutions have to implement remuneration policies in compliance with the specific provisions in a way that is appropriate for the respective category of staff, e.g. it can be appropriate that the remuneration policy sets out different maximum ratios for the variable remuneration or different deferral arrangements for specific categories of identified staff as their impact on the risk profile during the business cycle differs. As stated in recital 65 of the CRD, the limitation of the variable remuneration to 100% of the fixed remuneration (200% with shareholders' approval) should be applied in any case.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:11]
PARAGRAPH_69942: 30.With regard to the requirement under Article 94 of the CRD that institutions pay out at least 50% of the variable remuneration of identified staff in instruments and that they defer the pay out for a part of the variable remuneration, the co-legislator has introduced the possibility that Member States waive the application of those provisions for institutions that are not large and have total assets under a certain threshold set within national law and for staff with a variable remuneration of EUR 50 000 or below, when it does not represent more than one third of the staff member's total annual remuneration. For this purpose, the amounts of variable and fixed remuneration have to be calculated in each financial year, using the amounts paid for the previous financial year. E.g. to determine if the waiver can be applied to the variable remuneration of the financial year ending 31.12.2020, the institutions should calculate the fixed remuneration awarded for 2020 and the variable remuneration awarded in 2021 for 2020, including all amounts for performance periods that have ended in 2020, which may include performance periods that are longer than one year. When implementing the quantitative thresholds, Member States have some flexibility regarding the amounts, as further specified in the CRD. While the implementation of waivers and thresholds is at the discretion of Member States, the guidelines contain some procedural requirements on their application.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:12] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_69949: 32.All institutions have to identify the staff whose professional activities have a material impact on the individual institutions' risk profile. In line with Articles 92 and 109(2) of the CRD, the identification also has to be performed at a consolidated and sub-consolidated level, including certain subsidiaries which are not themselves subject to the CRD, while other subsidiaries are excluded from the scope of consolidated application of the specific remuneration provisions. The primary responsibility for the identification process for the consolidated and sub- consolidated level lies with the consolidating institution. To ensure that the identification can be performed at these levels, it is appropriate to require that subsidiaries should actively participate in the identification process by providing the necessary information to assess the impact of staff at a consolidated level. To ensure the complete and harmonised identification of staff, the guidelines set out how institutions should apply the identification criteria set within Article 92(3) of the CRD and the Commission Delegated Regulation mandated under Article 94(2) of the CRD.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:12] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_69952: 34.Institutions must have a sound capital basis. Remuneration represents an important cost factor for institutions and remuneration payments directly influence the institution's capital base and liquidity. There is also an indirect influence on the capital base (i.e. the impact of the remuneration policy on the risks taken for which capital is required). If an institution falls short of its capital targets, priority is to be given to building up the necessary capital or solvency buffer and a conservative remuneration policy needs to be pursued, particularly regarding variable remuneration. To ensure that remuneration does not endanger the financial stability of the institution, remuneration must also be taken into account for capital and liquidity planning purposes. Article 104(1)(g) of the CRD empowers competent authorities to require institutions to limit variable remuneration as a percentage of net revenues where it is inconsistent with the maintenance of a sound capital base and Articles 141 and 141b of the CRD and Article 16 a of Directive 2014/59/EU limits distributions, including the variable remuneration, where the combined capital buffer or the leverage ratio or the combined buffer when considered in addition to the requirements referred to in Article 45c and 45d of Directive 2014/59/EU (minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities) are not met.

PARAGRAPH_69957: 35.According to Article 94 of the CRD, it must be ensured that the fixed and variable components of total remuneration are appropriately balanced and the fixed component represents a sufficiently high proportion to allow a fully flexible policy on variable remuneration. Remuneration is either fixed or variable; there is no third category of remuneration. The correct mapping into these two categories is crucial for the calculation of the ratio between the variable and the fixed component and to safeguard that the limitation of this ratio is complied with.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:13] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_69958: 36. Variable remuneration should provide incentives for prudent risk taking in the long term and for sound risk management. Fixed remuneration should primarily reflect the relevant professional experience and organisational responsibility of staff and provide for a stable source of income. In any case, according to the CRD, variable remuneration must not be paid through vehicles or methods that facilitate the non-compliance with the CRD or CRR.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:13]
PARAGRAPH_69959: 37. The criteria for the allocation of remuneration to the fixed or variable component are not limited to the awarding of remuneration or the contractual conditions, but also the way in which remuneration is paid should be taken into account. It should be noted that the pay out of remuneration which would per se meet the requirements for fixed remuneration but is made in instruments rather than cash may be understood as performance-related depending on the features of the instrument awarded. Where remuneration is subject to additional contractual conditions (e.g. malus and clawback), these conditions would contradict the criterion that fixed remuneration should be predetermined.

PARAGRAPH_69960: Requirements for variable remuneration

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:13]
PARAGRAPH_69961: 38. Variable remuneration provides an incentive for staff members to pursue the goals and interests of the institution and enables them to share in its success. It is also an element of cost flexibility for institutions. Provided that the interests of the institution's owners are taken into account and there is no incentive to assume inappropriate or excessive risks, an appropriate level of variable remuneration can benefit all stakeholders of an institution. A variable component linked to performance, the deferral of variable remuneration and its award in shares, share-linked or equivalent instruments or in bail-in-able other instruments issued by the institution can have a positive effect on 'risk-sharing', incentivising prudent behaviour and ensuring a safe and sound performance of the institution.

PARAGRAPH_69969: 41.Any form of variable remuneration should always be consistent with and promote sound and effective risk management.

Therefore, institutions need to be able to justify the use of any variable remuneration element, including allowances, retention bonuses, guaranteed variable remuneration and severance payments.

PARAGRAPH_69970: 42.Remuneration has a direct or indirect influence on staff's behaviour. Variable remuneration may encourage staff to take undesirable, irresponsible and excessive risks or to sell non-suitable products in the hope of generating more turnover or making more profit in the short run and thus increasing staff's variable remuneration. Furthermore, staff members may be tempted to game with or manipulate information with a view to making their (measured) performance look better. E.g. if the variable part of the remuneration consists predominantly of remuneration instruments that are paid out immediately, without any deferral or ex post risk adjustment mechanisms (e.g. malus or clawback), or are based on a formula that links variable remuneration to current year revenues rather than risk-adjusted profit, there are strong incentives for staff to shy away from conservative valuation policies, to ignore concentration risks, to rig the internal transfer pricing system in their favour and to ignore risk factors, such as liquidity risk and concentration risk, that could place the institution under stress in the future. By connecting risk management provisions to the remuneration policy, the aforementioned risks can be counterbalanced.

Relative performance measures are measures that compare performance with peers, either 'internal' peers (i.e. within the organisation) or 'external' (i.e. similar institutions). The advantage of absolute measures is that they are easier to set and monitor. Relative measures could encourage excessive risk taking and therefore need always to be supplemented by other metrics and controls, including the use of prudent judgmental analysis during the award process.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:15]
PARAGRAPH_69981: 49.In a period of sector-wide positive financial performances, external relative measures could lead to increased risk taking and a herd mentality, with a potential negative impact on the financial stability of the financial sector. In a downturn economic cycle where most institutions perform poorly, relative external measures may lead to positive measurements of a per se negative outcome and thus to an insufficient contraction of the institution's total variable remuneration.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:15]
PARAGRAPH_69982: 50.Similarly, internal (e.g. profits) and external (e.g. share price) variables come with both advantages and disadvantages that should be balanced carefully. Internal performance measures are able to generate more involvement of the staff members if they can influence the outcome by their own behaviour. On the other hand, such measures can be manipulated and can create distorted outcomes on a short-term basis. External performance measures are less subject to the risk of manipulation, although e.g. attempts to artificially increase the stock price can still occur.

PARAGRAPH_69983: 51.Every criterion used has its risks, limitations and advantages. Institutions need to take these into account and weight them carefully when determining the performance and risk criteria at every level (i.e. the institution, the business area and the individual) and use an appropriate mix to minimise the risks and assess the performance as objectively as possible.

PARAGRAPH_69990: 53.The above requirements regarding the pay out of variable remuneration should ensure that the variable remuneration is aligned with the risks of the institution in the long term and that ex post risk adjustments can be applied as appropriate.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:16]
PARAGRAPH_69991: 54.A deferral schedule is key to ensuring risk alignment effects in a remuneration package, since it allows for parts of the remuneration to be adjusted for risk outcomes over time through ex post risk adjustments. The ratio of deferred remuneration to variable remuneration and the deferral period needs to be tailored to the long-term impact of the category of identified staff throughout the business cycle and therefore arrangements may differ between different categories of identified staff and will also depend on the institution's business model.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:16] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_69992: 55.Although variable remuneration should already be aligned to risk through ex ante risk adjustments, due to the uncertainty about the assessment and future development of risks, ex post risk adjustments are needed to keep incentives fully aligned over an appropriate time period. This can only be achieved where an appropriate part of the variable remuneration is deferred. In particular in Member States where the application of malus or clawback may not be in line with the general principles of national contract and labour law, institutions should carefully design the instruments used for the award, the deferral and the retention scheme in order to ensure that needed ex post risk adjustments are reflected, e.g. in price changes of the instruments.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:16]
PARAGRAPH_69993: 56.It is important to highlight that the upfront payment of instruments as variable remuneration, even if the retention period equals the applied deferral period, is not equivalent to the deferral of instruments.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:16]
PARAGRAPH_69994: 57.Retention periods affect the risk-taking incentives of staff members only by extending the period during which implicit adjustments can take place. Instruments paid upfront belong to the staff member (they are vested rights), which implies that no malus clauses (i.e. no reduction of the number of instruments that will be received) can be applied to them. Even though clawback may be applicable, the ability to apply ex post risk adjustment will be weakened and is without prejudice to the national labour and contract laws.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:16]
PARAGRAPH_69995: 58.Unlike retained instruments, deferred instruments allow for the application of explicit ex post risk adjustments via malus arrangements, e.g. determined by the back-testing of the underlying performance, possibly leading to a reduction of the number of instruments that will eventually vest and be paid out.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:16]
PARAGRAPH_69996: 59.Ex post risk adjustments should not lead to an increase in the variable remuneration as they would expose the staff member to both the positive and the negative parts of the outcomes, providing incentives to take more risk than that which can be considered prudent from a supervisory point of view to recover parts of variable remuneration in case they were reduced following the application of ex post risk adjustments.

PARAGRAPH_70000: 60.When the variable remuneration takes the form of instruments, the final monetary value received by staff depends also on the market prices or the fair value of these instruments. This implicit adjustment of remuneration due to changes in the market price of listed instruments or the fair value of non-listed instruments is not related to any explicit decision of the institution, but inherent to the instruments used for the award. Market prices respond to many factors and are without additional ex post risk adjustments not sufficient to align the variable remuneration with the risks taken in the long term. The same is true for the fair value, which in addition is less objective than an observed market price.

Remuneration policies must be aligned to these circumstances. This may include that the award and pay out of variable remuneration is limited; where variable remuneration is awarded, an even stronger risk alignment seems to be appropriate, contributing to the protection of the capital base and aiding the recovery of the institution.

The remuneration policy for all staff should comply with the principles set out in Articles 92 and 94 of Directive 2013/36/EU and these guidelines, taking into account the mapping of the requirements within Annex I9 . The remuneration policy for all staff should be gender neutral, i.e. staff, independent of their gender, should be equally remunerated for equal work or work of equal value in line with point 65 of Article 3(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU and Article 157 of the TFEU.

Changes of such objectives and measures should be taken into account when updating the remuneration policy. Institutions should ensure that remuneration practices are aligned with their overall risk appetite, taking into account all risks, including reputational risks and risks resulting from the mis-selling of products. Institutions should also take into account the long-term interests of shareholders or owners, depending on the legal form of the institution.

PARAGRAPH_70154: 26. In order to monitor that gender-neutral remuneration policies are applied, institutions should document appropriately the value of the position, e.g. by documenting job descriptions or defining wage categories, for all staff members or categories of staff and determine which positions are considered as having an equal value, e.g. by implementing a job classification system, taking into account at least the type of activities, tasks and duties assigned to the position or staff member. Where a job classification system is used for determining pay, it should be based on the same criteria for men, women and staff of diverse genders and drawn up so as to exclude any discrimination, including on grounds of gender.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:46]
PARAGRAPH_70422: 113.The independent risk management and independent compliance functions, the business support functions (e.g. legal, human resources) and the relevant committees of the management body (i.e. risk, nomination and audit committees) should be involved in the identification process in accordance with their respective role and also on an ongoing basis. In particular, where a risk committee is established, it should be involved in the identification process without prejudice to the tasks of the remuneration committee. Institutions should ensure a proper exchange of information among all internal bodies and functions involved in the identification process. The identification process and its result should be subject to an independent internal or external review.

The identification process on a consolidated basis should include staff members as defined in Article 109(5) of Directive 2013/36/EU, even if the subsidiary that employs that staff member is not subject to the application of the requirements in Articles 92, 94 and 95 of Directive 2013/36/EU on a consolidated basis and is not subject to Directive 2013/36/EU on an individual basis.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:47]
PARAGRAPH_70429: 115.When applying qualitative identification criteria at consolidated or sub-consolidated level, staff members in a subsidiary are only captured if they are responsible for the functions referred to in these criteria on a consolidated or sub-consolidated basis. E.g. a staff member in a subsidiary who is a member of the management body of such subsidiary should be captured by the criterion 'the staff member is a member of the management body in its management function' only if he or she is also a member of the management body of the EU parent institution.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:47]

PARAGRAPH_70439: 120.Subsidiaries that are not themselves subject to Directive 2013/36/EU are not required to perform an identification process at an individual level, unless they are required to do so under sector-specific remuneration requirements. For those subsidiaries that are not subject to the Directive or other specific remuneration requirements as specified under Article 109(4) of Directive 2013/36/EU, the assessment should be performed by the consolidating institution at the consolidated and sub-consolidated level, based on information provided by the subsidiary. Institutions falling within the scope of Directive 2013/36/EU should conduct their own self- assessment for the identification of staff at an individual level. Small and less complex institutions which are included in an identification process on a consolidated basis may delegate the practical application of the identification process at an individual level to the consolidating institution.

PARAGRAPH_70440: 121.Branches in a Member State of credit institutions that have their head office in a third country and institutions in a Member State which are subsidiaries of parent institutions in third countries should conduct the identification process and inform their parent institution of its results. Institutions in a Member State should also include their subsidiaries that fall in the scope of prudential consolidation and branches located in third countries in their assessment. Institutions should be aware that branches form a non-independent part of the institution.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:48]

Variable remuneration should not be awarded or paid out when the effect would be that the capital base of the institution would no longer be sound. The institution should consider these requirements, the results from the internal capital adequacy assessment process, its multi-year capital planning, the restrictions on distributions set out in Articles 141 and 141b of Directive 2013/36/EU and Article 16a of Directive 2014/59/EU and recommendations on distributions by competent authorities and European Supervisory Authorities, when determining:

Institutions should document the event or justification that made it necessary to award a retention bonus and the time period, including the start and the end date, for which the reason is assumed to exist. Institutions should define the retention conditions and applicable performance conditions (see also paragraph 147). Institutions should specify a retention period and a date or event after which it determines whether the retention and performance conditions have been met.

Institutions should take into account expected and unexpected losses and stressed conditions. For example, if an institution uses an Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) to calculate its operational capital requirements, this methodology will already include high-severity losses and scenario analysis.

However, formulae may not capture all objectives, especially the qualitative ones, which can be better captured by judgemental approaches. The judgemental approach gives more flexibility to management and can, therefore, weaken the risk-based incentive effect of the performance-based variable remuneration.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:88]
PARAGRAPH_71055: 1. Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) (EBA Regulation) provides that the EBA should carry out an analysis of 'the potential related costs and benefits' of any guidelines it develops. This analysis should provide an overview of the findings regarding the problem to be dealt with, the solutions proposed and the potential impact of these options.

PARAGRAPH_71056: A. Problem identification and policy objectives

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:88]
PARAGRAPH_71057: 2. Directive 2013/36/EU has been amended. The EBA guidelines on sound remuneration policies needed to be amended to reflect those changes and supervisory experience regarding the application of the currently applicable guidelines (EBA-GL-2015-22).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:88] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_71058: 3. The amendments to the guidelines should ensure that there are gender-neutral remuneration policies and clarity about the application of the requirements within groups and with regard to the application of waivers. Further clarity on the treatment of retention bonuses and severance payments has been provided to ensure that such tools are not used to circumvent remuneration requirements and in particular the bonus cap. The EBA has been mandated to develop draft RTS on disclosures and therefore guidelines on disclosures have been removed from the guidelines.

PARAGRAPH_71060: 4.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:88]
PARAGRAPH_71061: 5. The impact assessment covers guidelines developed to ensure the harmonised application of the amended remuneration requirements introduced by Directive 2013/36/EU and areas where the policy has changed. Areas that have not changed in substance and the underlying changes introduced within Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 have not been assessed.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:88] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_71062: 6. Following changes to the scope of application of the CRD, several parts of the GL had to be aligned accordingly to reflect the changes within the CRD. There has not been another option as the guidelines must follow the legal text in this respect and therefore no cost-benefit analysis is provided for such changes to the guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:89]
PARAGRAPH_71068: 7. The scope of application of the CRD changes and specific requirements regarding remuneration policies are being introduced for investment firms in June 2021 with Directive (EU) 2034/2019. At the same time, further amendments to the CRD are coming into force. On 28 December 2020, additional requirements enter into force, including that institutions' remuneration policies are gender neutral.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:89]
PARAGRAPH_71069: 8. Considering the time needed for the implementation of guidelines, the extent of the changes made and also the resources available at EBA, it has been decided to revise the guidelines only once, instead of providing guidelines for the amendments that apply from 28 December 2020 and 26 June 2021 separately. To allow for a sufficiently long implementation period, the date of application has been moved back to 31.12.2021.

PARAGRAPH_71070: Gender-neutral remuneration policies

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:89] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_71071: 9. The CRD requires institutions to have gender-neutral remuneration policies. The principle of gender neutrality and the need to provide for equal opportunities are included in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. Guidelines should ensure that those principles are implemented efficiently.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:89]
PARAGRAPH_71072: Option A: The guidelines should provide for measures that enable a review of whether remuneration policies are indeed gender neutral.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:89] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_71073: 10. To ensure that work done by different staff is comparable, institutions need to properly document the responsibilities of staff or have a job classification system in place. Institutions should also identify the gender pay gap and monitor its development over time. The ratios included in the guidelines help to make such differences comparable between different institutions and enable auditors and supervisors to challenge the appropriateness of policies. However, considering the demographic differences between Member States and institutions, such indicators cannot form hard criteria. Another option would have been to provide for very granular criteria for comparing payment levels, but such criteria would possibly not suit all business models and would be too burdensome to apply.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:89]
PARAGRAPH_71074: Option B: The guidelines should clarify aspects that could justify differences in pay that are not related to gender.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:89] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_71075: Some differentiations in pay are possible, but must not lead to any discrimination. The guidelines specify common provisions that may lead to a differentiation in pay to provide for legal certainty that such differentiations are not considered to be discriminatory, even if some payments may be more often made to the female gender (e.g. child allowances).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:90] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_71080: To ensure that remuneration is gender neutral in the long run and that all genders have the same chance of progression, it is appropriate to require institutions to ensure that they provide for equal opportunities, even if in the short run such measures do not reduce any pay gap that might exist.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:90]
PARAGRAPH_71081: Option D: The guidelines should clarify that gender neutrality is not limited to the male and female gender, but also applies to diverse genders where implemented by Member States.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:90] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_71082: While the TFEU and CRD do not specify a diverse gender, many Member States have implemented such gender to ensure that there is no discrimination of e.g. transgender persons. The principle of gender neutrality should apply to all genders. There is no other effective option that avoids gender discrimination of any kind.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:90] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_71083: 11. All options have been retained to provide an effective framework for ensuring gender-neutral remuneration policies and equal opportunities. The implementation will cause one-off costs to amend policies and establish (if not in place) documentation (e.g. job descriptions); low ongoing costs will be created due to the calculation of pay gap data.

PARAGRAPH_71084: Group application and waivers

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:90]
PARAGRAPH_71085: 12. Article 109 of the CRD sets out how remuneration requirements are applied in the group context. The guidelines provide clarity about the application of this provision, including where Article 109 has changed. The guidelines in particular clarify that firms that are subject to a specific remuneration requirement are not subject to the CRD provisions unless Member States make use of the derogation in Article 109(6) or Article 109(5) applies to single staff members. This does not lead to additional costs.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:90]
PARAGRAPH_71086: 13. The guidelines clarify how the thresholds for waivers should be calculated. The implementation of the waivers and the level of thresholds used (within the limits provided within the CRD) as such is subject to national discretion.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:90]
PARAGRAPH_71087: 14. The waivers have been introduced by the co-legislators to reduce the burden for institutions that are not large or for staff that have a low amount of variable remuneration as the costs would exceed the prudential benefit. Institutions that are subsidiaries of large institutions can rely on the resources of their parent institution and can use the instruments issued by it.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:90]
PARAGRAPH_71088: 15. The guidelines specify how different elements of remuneration are taken into account when the threshold for staff is calculated. Two options have been considered:

PARAGRAPH_71093: Option B: Including all elements of variable remuneration and only the directly quantifiable elements of fixed remuneration with the option to include other fixed elements as well.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:91]
PARAGRAPH_71094: Option B has been retained. Leaving out a few elements of fixed remuneration increases the ratio between the variable and the fixed part of remuneration. Therefore there is no prudential risk, but the higher level of flexibility reduces the cost for the application of waivers under CRD.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:91]
PARAGRAPH_71095: 16. No additional costs are created by the guidelines on the application of waivers; the costs are driven by the provisions within the CRD directly.

PARAGRAPH_71097: 17. Supervisory review in some Member States showed that institutions sometimes used retention bonuses to replace performance-based bonuses and that the justification provided was not always sufficient. Two options have been considered:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:91]
PARAGRAPH_71098: Option A: Keeping the guidelines in place as the supervisory dialogue with individual institutions will lead to a correct application of the requirements in the longer run.

PARAGRAPH_71099: Option B: Providing further clarity on the conditions of retention bonuses and the assessment of their appropriateness.

PARAGRAPH_71102: 18. Supervisory review in some Member States showed that institutions also used severance payment in situations where they were actually discretionary pension benefits or other payments than for the early termination of the contract by institutions to the benefit of the specific regime for the calculation of the ratio between the variable and fixed remuneration. Two options have been considered:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:91]
PARAGRAPH_71103: Option A: Keeping the guidelines in place as the supervisory dialogue with individual institutions will lead to a correct application of the requirements in the longer run.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:92]
PARAGRAPH_71111: 19. Given the limited amendments to the guidelines and given that they are based on amendments of Directive 2013/36/EU and other existing legal requirements, it is assumed that the changes to the guidelines as such create low implementation costs mainly for updates to internal policies and additional required documentation. Where implemented by the competent authority, a pre-assessment of severance payments will lead to some additional costs at institutions and competent authorities. Such assessments, if implemented, should therefore be limited to severance payments that are material.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:93]
PARAGRAPH_71116: The guidelines have been consulted on for a three-month period until 29 January 2021. The EBA received overall 18 responses; 17 of them have been published. One was submitted on a confidential basis. In addition, the EBA's Banking Stakeholder Group (BSG) submitted its opinion.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:93]
PARAGRAPH_71117: Most respondents noted that the date of application is too ambitious and the institutions need some time for internal implementation of the new guidelines (in particular, concerning the analysis and application of the gender-neutral principle or the modifications to the identification process). Many respondents suggested delaying the date of application to 1 January 2022.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:93]
PARAGRAPH_71118: Some respondents found that the guidelines go further than explicitly stated in Directive 2013/36/EU (CRD) regarding gender-neutral remuneration policies. For instance, the obligation for the supervisory function (or remuneration committee/internal audit function) to analyse the 'gender pay gap' would be burdensome, while it would not be required for the purpose of gender- neutral remuneration policies. Having job descriptions has been considered as too burdensome. Also it has been considered that the guidelines have too wide a scope as they include aspects on equal opportunities. Respondents proposed to introduce references to the application of proportionality and to exclude some institutions from the measurement of the gender pay gap.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:93]
PARAGRAPH_71119: A few respondents highlighted the importance of avoiding 'conflicts of laws' among the guidelines and national social and labour legislations or conflicts with regard to collective bargaining, in particular concerning gender-neutral remuneration policies.

PARAGRAPH_71122: On severance payments, many respondents expressed concerns on new provisions and found them too restrictive, which could lead to a situation where court settlements would become necessary in order to comply with the bonus cap.

PARAGRAPH_71129: The EBA has taken into account the comments received and the opinion of the Banking Stakeholder Group and revised the guidelines. The guidelines aim to further specify requirements under the CRD and to achieve harmonisation at the EU level. Given the need of Member States to implement the CRD provisions and to abide by the principles set out within the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, it would be surprising if social or labour law, including collective bargaining, would lead to results that are not gender neutral. Therefore, it is presumed that the guidelines do not lead to any conflicts regarding those matters. However, the obligation to ensure a gender- neutral remuneration policy is on the institutions and not on the social partners that negotiate employment conditions.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:94]
PARAGRAPH_71130: The EBA is aware of the challenges that might exist regarding the application of remuneration requirements on a consolidated basis to firms that are not themselves subject to the CRD. However, the scope of the guidelines is set in line with the scope of application of the CRD. Guidelines cannot reduce the scope of application set out in the CRD. The date of application has been moved back as suggested: the guidelines will enter into force at the end of 2021 and will then apply to institutions' remuneration policies.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:94] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_71131: All aspects of the remuneration policy must be gender neutral. Some aspects concerning equal opportunities and anti-discrimination have been further specified in the EBA guidelines on internal governance. However, some aspects have also been retained in these guidelines as they are linked to the remuneration of staff. This is in line with Article 75 of the CRD that requires the benchmarking of the gender pay gap, which is also linked to the issue of how the principle of equal opportunities and respective national requirements 38 are implemented within institutions' governance arrangements, which include remuneration policies as specified in Article 74 of the CRD. The guidelines have been revised to reduce the burden for the implementation of a job categorisation regime. The EBA will provide additional guidance regarding the benchmarking of the gender pay gap in line with its mandate under Article 75 of the CRD.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:94]
PARAGRAPH_71132: The guidelines have been revised to provide more clarity on retention bonuses and on severance pay. Retention bonuses are variable remuneration and therefore subject to the requirements under Article 94 of the CRD.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:94]
PARAGRAPH_71133: The different calculation of amounts regarding the application of waivers under Article 94(3) of the CRD and the application of the bonus cap in the context of severance payments has been retained, but has been further specified. The calculation differs as the context and the underlying provisions of the CRD differ. The thresholds for the application of waivers are set out in the CRD and cannot be increased by guidelines. The waivers introduced and thresholds set by the co-legislators have the purpose of reducing the burden for the pay out of a part of the variable remuneration in instruments and under deferral arrangements, in situations where only a low amount is paid. Where in fact a higher amount is paid out, the prudential benefits of applying those requirements exceed the burden for their application.

PARAGRAPH_71138: The different calculation of amounts in the context of severance payments is a technical necessity and ensures that the limitation of the ratio between variable and fixed remuneration can be applied in a meaningful way. If some amounts would not be excluded from the calculation of the maximum ratio, institutions would be forced to either breach the requirements or to have a decision by the court in several cases of severance payments. The calculation of a ratio with regard to severance payments also differs as the payment is made for the early termination of a contract and not for a defined performance period. Also, in the case of an early termination of a contract, the variable remuneration received should be aligned with the institution's risks.

PARAGRAPH_71162: Some respondents pointed out that the 'Gender-neutral remuneration policies' goes beyond the scope of the CRD. The respondents' proposals were to: delete the first sentence in paragraph 22 (concerning career perspectives, senior management representation and diversity); clarify in paragraph 23 the wording 'any form of discrimination, based on gender or otherwise' since the reference in the CRD (as well as in Article 157 of the TFEU); is made exclusively to gender and an extension of the requirements could have further-reaching consequences; clearly communicate that collectively agreed remuneration policies are in principle regarded as non-discriminatory, since

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:96] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_71163: Not all staff receive pay based on collectively agreed contracts, which indeed should be providing for remuneration levels independent of staff's gender. However, it is on the institution to ensure that the remuneration policies are gender neutral and not the responsibility of the social partners. It is a core value of the EU that discrimination cannot be tolerated; it is encoded in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. This principle also has to be respected by institutions' robust governance arrangements and within remuneration policies.

PARAGRAPH_71173: The issue of gender representation at the level of the management body is linked to career prospects and the available pool of candidates of all genders. Respecting the principle of equal opportunities, even if not strictly related to remuneration policies, should help to build up a diverse pool of candidates. Hence, ensuring equal opportunities is relevant within institutions' sound governance arrangements. The background section, which is not part of the guidelines, explains how those different aspects are linked. The background section has been clarified.

PARAGRAPH_71194: Some respondents noted that the definition of gender pay gap does not take into account the type of work, level of responsibility or experience, thus this definition is insufficient to meet the purpose of having gender-neutral remuneration policies and also differs from the 'equal pay for equal work or work of equal value'. In addition, it is proposed to replace the term 'earnings' with 'remuneration'; and the term 'hourly' with 'full-time annual remuneration awarded' or 'monthly/yearly remuneration' or 'gross annual remuneration'. In addition, it is proposed to link this definition with the methodology defined in section 2.5

PARAGRAPH_71195: In line with work published by the European Parliament39, the gender pay gap is the difference in average gross hourly earnings between women and men. It is based on salaries paid directly to employees before income tax and social security contributions are deducted. Calculated this way, the gender pay gap does not take into account all the different factors that may play a role, for example education, hours worked, type of job, career breaks or part-time work. The gender pay gap indicates more than just the difference in hourly or annual gross remuneration for the same job (which should not be different at all), but provides information on how successfully equal opportunities have been provided within society and within the institution.

PARAGRAPH_71265: Some respondents noted that provisions contained in paragraph 26 or 27 may interfere with national legislation or collective bargaining agreements. In this regard, it is proposed to use the compliance with the collective bargaining agreement provisions as evidence of having a gender-neutral remuneration policy. Also, it is suggested to clarify that institutions located in jurisdictions where there is an obligation to analyse equal pay for work of equal value should not be subject to additional requirements, in order to avoid the risk of redundant or even contradictory requirements among the GL and national laws. However, one respondent considered that a detailed list of criteria on what is a gender-neutral position should be included in the GL. In addition, several respondents asked for (according to the proportionality principle) an elaboration on categories of job positions instead of documenting job descriptions for all institutions' staff members (or carry out an assessment by bands, which simplifies the mapping of staff within an institution); and the use of current methods to measure the 'weight' of positions, instead of determining which positions are considered as equal or of equal value based on 'unit of measurement or time rate' (or let institutions decide how to monitor that gender-neutral remuneration policies are applied).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:101]
PARAGRAPH_71266: These GLs do not oblige institutions to follow a different approach regarding contracts with employees than the one prescribed in the national legislation, including conditions established by collective bargaining. The mandate of the EBA is to ensure compliance with the principle of equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value, thus there is a need to identify the jobs considered as equal or of equal value. Where national law has the same objective as the GL, it is highly unlikely that there are contradictions between the requirements that would prevent institutions from complying with all requirements. It should be remembered that GL are subject to a comply or explain process that would allow competent authorities to remedy such situations if they existed. This identification could be carried out according to existing methods. The principle of proportionality (e.g. the proportionate application of all provisions) applies to the whole GL. Some clarifications have been accommodated in this regard (concerning job descriptions and reference to 'unit of measurement or time rate').

In addition, it is proposed to review in general the objective of the paragraph; and particularly the wording of letters (a) and (h); and to align the criteria with the requirements developed by the Commission to assess what is equal value of work (Commission Recommendation C(2014) 1405).

The proportionality principle would apply also based on either the fact that in some countries the national law already requires a reporting or there are institutions remunerating on a collective bargaining basis. In addition, it has been highlighted that there is a need of defining accurate standard reporting criteria to develop a consistent reporting line over time; and it is proposed to consider the size and activity of each institution when assessing the differences on average pay.

In particular, where institutions are already subject to similar reporting requirements, making available such data to competent authorities as well should create only a limited burden. The GL have been reviewed to provide more clarity and limit the burden for the smallest institutions. Related governance aspects have been moved to the EBA guidelines on internal governance.

It has been considered confusing to combine the calculation of remuneration (for the identification of material risk takers) and the ratio; in this regard, it is proposed to clarify that in order to calculate variable remuneration compared to fixed remuneration, institutions should consider remuneration

PARAGRAPH_71391: related to a performance year, while for MRT identification institutions have the choice to take remuneration awarded in relation to a performance year or remuneration awarded in a performance year. Also in this respect, the EBA has been asked to provide guidance on the second part of letter (a) and on how to consider (for estimating the threshold) the amounts mentioned in paragraph (c) or (d) in any moment before the award of variable remuneration (for example, at this time it could be possible that a retention bonus was not foreseen to be awarded in this performance year) or directly to include the option to replace references to 'remuneration awarded for the preceding last year' with references to 'current performance year'. Other comments in this regard were: Include in point (c) the option of a pro rata allocation in case of variable remuneration relating to multi-year performance or periods; and clarify in point (d) that severance payments excluded from the bonus cap and the deferral and payment in instruments are not taken into consideration for the calculation of the remuneration awarded.

PARAGRAPH_71392: financial year should be understood to be the same as the performance year. Additional simplifications/clarifications have been made, in particular concerning the financial/performance year to consider in letters (a) to (d). The guidelines regarding multi-year periods have not been changed as in fact the variable remuneration will be awarded in a specific year independent of the fact that there might be a longer performance period. The waivers were granted to reduce the burden of applying the requirements where only low amounts of variable remuneration have been awarded. Where a higher award is made, the prudential advantages of applying the requirements exceed the regulatory burden. For severance payments, it needs to be considered that the staff member is an identified staff member and risk alignment measures are therefore deemed necessary, even if the threshold is exceeded only by the award of a severance payment. Clarifications have been provided.

PARAGRAPH_71434: to grant more than one retention bonus linked to one event, provided that the aggregated amount is taken into account for the purposes of the relevant bonus cap. Some respondents focused on the sentence 'or under simultaneous events or justifications', and proposed to repeal this part of the paragraph which would lead to the consideration, within the concept of retention bonus, of amounts provided for in collective plans (often negotiated and agreed with the trade unions) besides the amounts agreed in individual agreements. It has been considered that there may well be justified and legitimate reasons for awarding to individual staff members, already participating in collective plans, an additional individual retention bonus as part of a stability agreement that provides for the acceptance of a specific obligation by the worker.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:110] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_71435: conditions are applied. Those specific conditions have been further specified. In some cases, retention bonuses have led to situations where the mere retention of staff becomes the driving factor of the bonus system, rather than the performance of the staff, business unit or institution. Such structures are not in line with the requirement of performance-related variable remuneration. Therefore, clarifications have been necessary. Multiple retention bonuses or retention conditions are possible only in exceptional and well-justified cases and as long as they do not lead to a misalignment of performance and the total variable remuneration. The guidelines have been clarified. The guidelines do not lead to a prohibition of a higher or additional retention bonus to a single staff member already included in agreements that concern a group of staff. However, all retention bonuses must be well justified.

PARAGRAPH_71451: significant amount will only be paid after the retention period is over and conditions fulfilled (in order to keep key staff motivated to help navigate the institution through tough times or similar circumstances). Another reason argued in favour of the pro rata award is based on paragraph 147, which allows payment of the retention bonus as a lump sum at the time the retention condition is met or pro rata over the retention period (should the employee resign before the end of the retention period, he would have to pay a predetermined penalty concerning the retention period not respected, thus generating unexpected income).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:111] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_71452: Retention bonuses are variable remuneration and subject to all requirements on variable remuneration. The GL have been amended to exclude the prohibition of multiple retention events. However, the retention of staff and the retention bonus must always be justified and multiple retention bonuses are considered an exceptional situation.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:111]
PARAGRAPH_71454: Some respondents suggested clarifying that retention bonuses could not be based on performance, since it may be deduced from the wording of this paragraph that retention bonuses should always be partly based on certain performance criteria, which does not seem its intention, and also would result in eliminating the ability to adopt collective retention plans (aimed at motivating staff and rewarding loyalty to the institution). According to this, it has been proposed the following modification: 'retention bonuses are not, or not exclusively, based on performance criteria'. Additionally, it is noted that individual performance conditions are already required in incentive plans; requiring them for retention bonuses would mean, in many cases, providing the same performance conditions for different types of bonuses. Another respondent suggested adding that the performance criteria could be fulfilled if the institution confirms (when deciding on the payment of the retention bonus) that any negative performance contributions of the employee prevent

Article 94(1)(n) of the CRD requires that variable remuneration of identified staff is performance related. 'The variable remuneration, including the deferred portion, is paid or vests only if it is sustainable according to the financial situation of the institution as a whole, and justified on the basis of the performance of the institution, the business unit and the individual concerned.' The specific performance conditions for retention bonuses can differ from performance conditions for other parts of the variable remuneration.

PARAGRAPH_71517: Many respondents recommended amending point (e): firstly, to mention again the 'potential labour disputes' since the intention should be to contain the risk, actual or potential, of disputes or litigation in court; in this case, the drafting proposed would be the following:

PARAGRAPH_71518: Where there is no dispute between staff and institution, there is no need to file a case in front of the court and an agreement e.g. under point (b) can be made. A dispute should not be understood as a situation where a court ruling would be the only way to come to a resolution of an existing issue. The point has been clarified.

PARAGRAPH_71523: One respondent called on the EBA to consider at least the possibility that compensation for the loss of notice period would not be treated as severance payment and, secondly, to clarify that the subparagraphs are examples of severance payments and not intended to be an exhaustive list.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:115]
PARAGRAPH_71524: By definition, a severance payment is a payment made for the early termination of a contract. A different issue is the calculation of the bonus cap. The list provided in the guidelines is not exhaustive.

PARAGRAPH_71527: Several concerns arose from the new wording of this paragraph, namely: (1) The consideration of transactional agreements on severance payments (agreed at the beginning of the contract and in certain cases intended to allow a 'cooling-off') as variable remuneration, which would entail the non-applicability of them to regulated staff (although legally allowed). (2) New conditions could lead to individuals to be less inclined to settle and, on the contrary, may increase litigations as individuals would seek court awards that are unrestricted. In addition, the cap on the amount of severance payments would

PARAGRAPH_71528: (1) The GL have been amended to allow for pre-agreed gardening leave payments or such payment under the policies of the institution, which would not be subject to the requirements of the variable remuneration where compatible with national law in situations where the staff member cancels the contract. Such payments could be made where the staff member is not allowed to take up an occupational activity that would cause conflicts of interests. Such payments should not be used to circumvent requirements on severance payments.

Thus, it has been recommended allowing institutions to pay severance payments above the amount pre-determined (in accordance with letter (b) point (i)) if the institution is able to demonstrate the reasons and appropriateness of the severance payment. (3) The reason for including amounts corresponding to non- competition clauses separately from other severance payments. In this regard, it has been suggested including the comprehensive list of payments from paragraph 165 within paragraph 170 letter (b) point (i). (4) Reference to Article 94 of the CRD. It has been considered that such reference should be deleted or limited to the requirements of Article 94 which should apply to severance payments. (5) The meaning of 'appropriate' in point (i); it has been considered that some examples should be included in this regard. (6) It is believed that the strict use of predefined generic formula is not justified (and in some jurisdictions not possible) and could entail the risk that it will become the new 'normal'. To allow for some flexibility, it has been suggested to clarify that (i) multiple redefined generic formulas are permitted; and (ii) within such predefined generic formula, an institution may use a discretionary factor or multiple as long as the institution can continue to demonstrate the appropriateness of and the reasons for an increase above a neutral application of such

PARAGRAPH_71538: (2) The CRD requires that payments for the early termination of contracts by institutions are based on performance. Hence, they are variable remuneration and must be subject to ex post performance adjustments and partly be paid out in instruments, unless the waivers under Article 94(3) of the CRD are applied. GL cannot create additional waivers. .

(7) The meaning of 'additional amounts due' in point (ii). Other amendments proposed to this paragraph are: clarify that severance payments should not be counted when calculating the thresholds under Art 94(3) of the CRD; and insert an additional letter (c) excluding severance payments which are part of an agreement between the institution and employee representatives under national law.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:117]
PARAGRAPH_71553: Several respondents objected to this paragraph (and proposed its deletion) for a number of reasons: it would go against the institution's capacity to elaborate compensation packages (resulting in a reduction of its ability to remain competitive and retain talent and lengthening the time needed for the management to terminate the employment contract, when in some jurisdictions the severance payment has already been approved by the board of directors) and also it seems to imply that the CA would decide on the suitability for at least material payments of all severance payments, which would go beyond the objectives of the CRD and it is likely to cause challenges of CAs supervising institutions with subsidiaries and branches in several locations across the world, since these authorities would not have the necessary expertise to determine what constitutes a material severance payment in all applicable jurisdictions (and also if the CA denied the institution's decision, it could lead to proceedings against the CA). In addition, some respondents suggested elaborating on the meaning of 'material' payments (taking into account that the

PARAGRAPH_71554: Institutions' remuneration and severance packages must be in line with applicable laws. The CA would not set the severance payment, but supervise the institutions' compliance with applicable laws. The previous GL already included provisions that foresaw the involvement of competent authorities. The possibility of ex ante involvement, if implemented by competent authorities, ensures appropriate supervision of the compliance with the requirements on variable remuneration by institutions awarding severance payments. Ex post controls would be less effective as in cases of non-compliance the only option would be taking supervisory measures towards the institution. The text of the previous GL on this issue has been reinstated. However, in any case, Member States may impose stricter requirements than set out in the guidelines regarding the supervisory involvement in such processes.

Where national legislation limits the length of non- competition clauses, any payment made beyond those time limits cannot be considered as a "settlement made for a non- competition clause" and therefore cannot be excluded from the ratio of variable to fixed pursuant to paragraph 170(b)(ii)'.

Therefore, it is deemed as more appropriate for CAs to focus their supervisory work on reviewing the internal policies of institutions on severance payments. Finally, it has also been appreciated that letters (b) and (c) would not be needed and could contradict paragraph 170: if severance payments comply with paragraph 170, they will be excluded from bonus cap, deferral and payment in instruments; if they do not comply with paragraph 170, they will be required to respect all requirements.

PARAGRAPH_71589: A few respondents provided their legal assessment, by virtue of which the requirement to 'defer a significantly higher portion than 50% of the variable remuneration paid in instruments' should be applied only to significant institutions, or alternatively, to members of the management body and senior management in 'institutions that do not benefit from the waiver within Article 94(3) of the CRD' (since the application of tighter rules on the deferral of variable remuneration for members of the MB and senior management is limited, by the CRD, only to 'significant' institutions).

PARAGRAPH_71590: The deferral period in the CRD refers to the significance of the institution, the guidelines have been amended accordingly also regarding the portion of instruments to be deferred. The members of the management body and senior management have the highest decision-making powers and therefore risk alignment measures, e.g. deferring a higher portion of the variable remuneration, are of particular importance. The guidelines already explicitly refer to the waivers under Article 94(3) of the CRD.

PARAGRAPH_71604: One respondent requested to elaborate on the meaning of 'the ratio of the variable to fixed remuneration of that staff member' for the definition of the particularly high amount, considering the applicability of cross function in an institution and to ensure a level playing field in Europe. However, other respondents suggested deleting the reference to the relative threshold, as otherwise small amounts of variable remuneration could be subject to stricter rules (deferral of 60%), which seems excessive, or even employees with lower total variable remuneration exceeding the relative threshold (but not the absolute amount) could be subject to stricter rules than employees with higher total variable remuneration (but with lower relative threshold).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:120]
PARAGRAPH_71605: Payment levels differ between Member States. As the requirement is applied to variable remuneration, it is appropriate to consider separately the variable and fixed remuneration components. The GL have been amended as this could also be based on the absolute amounts.

PARAGRAPH_71609: Many Member States have already in the past provided for the possibility to award remuneration in share-linked instruments also in listed companies. Institutions need to respect the agreement regarding the type of award with staff, unless there is consent to amend the agreement and such amendment is possible under national law. The GL have not been changed as there is neither the possibility to force such an agreement nor the need to forbid it.

PARAGRAPH_71627: One respondent argued that the specification on clawback set in this paragraph (its application in any case, independent from the size of the actual bonus award) would tighten the application rules in a way that could contradict the local labour market or the administrative rules in some jurisdictions, in addition this could negatively impact the attractiveness of the financial institutions and eventually mean that all existing MRT contracts have to be amended again. As a consequence, it has been proposed to provide local regulators with the necessary flexibility to reflect the principle of proportionality as it stands in the current GL.
