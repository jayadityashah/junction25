PARAGRAPH_101140: Executive Summary

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_101141: 1. The AML/CFT compliance function is central to credit or financial institutions' AML/CFT efforts. This is why Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing requires that credit or financial institutions appoint an AML/CFT compliance officer at the management level. It also provides that credit or financial institutions that have a management body identify the member of the management body who is ultimately responsible for the implementation of the law, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with AML/CFT requirements. It does not set out in detail how these provisions should be applied.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_101142: 2. Through these guidelines, the EBA will create a common understanding, by competent authorities and credit or financial institutions, of credit or financial institutions' AML/CFT governance arrangements. A common understanding, which is applied consistently and enforced as necessary, is key to strengthening the EU's AML/CFT defences.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_101143: 3. These guidelines set clear expectations of the role, tasks and responsibilities of the AML/CFT compliance officer and the management body. They specify that credit or financial institutions should appoint one member of their management body who will ultimately be responsible for the implementation of the AML/CFT obligations, and clarify the tasks and functions of that person. They also describe the roles and responsibilities of the AML/CFT compliance officer, when this person is appointed by the management body pursuant to the proportionality criteria. When the credit or financial institution is part of a group, the guidelines prescribe that a group AML/CFT compliance officer should be appointed and clarify this person's tasks and responsibilities.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_101144: 4. These guidelines apply to all existing management body structures and do not advocate any particular structure. They complement, but do not replace, relevant guidelines issued by the European Supervisory Authorities on wider governance arrangements and suitability checks.

PARAGRAPH_101146: The guidelines will be translated into the official EU languages and published on the EBA website. The deadline for competent authorities to report whether they comply with the guidelines will be two months after the publication of the translations. The guidelines will apply from 1 December 2022.

PARAGRAPH_101152: Background

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_101153: 5. Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing requires that credit or financial institutions have in place policies, controls and procedures to mitigate and manage effectively the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF). In accordance with Article 8(4) of this Directive, where appropriate with regard to the size and nature of the business, credit or financial institutions have to appoint a compliance officer at the management level. Article 46(4) further provides that credit or financial institutions that have a management body also identify the member of the management body who is ultimately responsible for the implementation of the law, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with AML/CFT requirements.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_101154: 6. These provisions complement requirements in other sectoral laws that relate to credit or financial institutions' governance and risk management systems, and suitability requirements for senior function holders.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_101155: 7. In 2017, in its Supranational Risk Assessment, the European Commission asked the ESAs to develop guidance to clarify the role of AML/CFT compliance officers in credit or financial institutions. At the time, the ESAs considered that existing guidelines on internal governance were sufficient to fulfil the Commission's request.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_101156: 8. There have, however, been a number of reports that suggest that the requirements set out in Directive (EU) 2015/849 have been implemented unevenly across different sectors and Member States, and that they are not always applied effectively. This can have adverse consequences for the integrity of the EU's financial system.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_101157: 9. For example,

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_101158: a) In their 2017 Joint Opinion on the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing affecting the Union's financial sector1, the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) considered that the Union's financial sector was exposed to money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks arising from ineffective AML/CFT systems and controls. Findings from national supervisors pointed to a number of causes for these shortcomings. These included senior management of some credit or financial institutions affording low priority to AML/CFT issues, in particular when paired with a corporate culture that pursues profits at the expense of robust compliance. This lack of senior management buy-in meant that ensuring adequate resources and hiring suitably qualified staff for AML/CFT roles were not seen as a priority, which appeared to affect the quality of financial institutions' AML/CFT controls.

PARAGRAPH_101163: b) The 2019 Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the assessment of recent alleged money laundering cases involving EU credit institutions2 found that many credit institutions in the Commission's sample had not established adequate risk management systems and controls. The analysis revealed deficiencies in credit institutions' anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism-related governance arrangements (including the 'three lines of defence'), their internal reporting, group policies and senior managements' responsibilities and accountability.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_101164: c) The EBA found in its 2019/2020 AML/CFT reviews of competent authorities' approaches to the AML/CFT supervision of banks3 that AML/CFT supervisors in some Member States did not interact with financial institutions' senior management because there was no legal or regulatory requirement in those Member States to appoint an AML/CFT compliance officer at a level that was sufficiently senior to report to the financial institution's senior management body. As a result, in those Member States there was a risk that AML/CFT supervision may not be effective.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_101165: d) The EBA noted in its 2021 Opinion on the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing affecting the European Union's financial sector4 that there was still a sizeable proportion of competent authorities that considered that the quality of some controls had remained poor and many competent authorities identified persisting deficiencies in some key controls.

PARAGRAPH_101167: 10.The EBA has a legal duty to prevent the use of the EU's financial system for ML/TF purposes, and a mandate to lead, monitor and coordinate the EU financial sector's fight against ML/TF.

PARAGRAPH_101170: 11.A common understanding of the role and responsibilities of AML/CFT compliance officers and the management body or senior manager, which is applied and enforced consistently, is important to ensure that credit or financial institutions in all Member States implement sound and effective AML/CFT systems and controls and to protect the EU's financial sector from financial crime.

PARAGRAPH_101559: A. Introduction

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:33] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_101560: 1. In several provisions of Directive (EU) 2015/849 there are references to the existence of senior management in charge of the AML/CFT compliance function that is required to approve business relationships or transactions involving high-risk third countries (Article 18a(1)(e) of Directive (EU) 2015/849), cross-border relationships with a third-country respondent institution (Article 19(c) of Directive (EU) 2015/849) and transactions or business relationships with politically exposed persons (Article 20(b)(i) of Directive (EU) 2015/849), among others. Moreover, senior management should approve policies, controls and procedures to mitigate and manage effectively the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing (Article 8(5) of Directive (EU) 2015/849).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:33] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_101561: 2. More specifically, Article 8(4a) of Directive (EU) 2015/849 makes reference to the appointment of a compliance officer at management level if appropriate and Article 46(4) of Directive (EU) 2015/849 requires entities to identify the member of the management body who is responsible for the implementation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the Level 1 text.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:33]
PARAGRAPH_101562: 3. In 2017 and 2019, the European Commission issued Reports on the assessment of the risks of ML/TF affecting the internal market and relating to cross-border activities30 ('Supra National Risk Assessment') in which it recommended that the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) provide guidelines to clarify the functions of compliance officers in financial institutions31.

PARAGRAPH_101563: B. Policy objectives

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:33]
PARAGRAPH_101564: 4. The guidelines aim at ensuring that the provisions of the Level 1 text are interpreted and applied consistently and effectively. To this end, the guidelines describe the responsibilities at all hierarchical levels of the AML/CFT compliance function. First, the roles and responsibilities of the management body in the AML/CFT framework are set out. Second, the role of the AML/CFT compliance officer is described at all phases (i.e. the expectations about the appointment, the tasks and the reporting to the management body).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:33]
PARAGRAPH_101565: 5. The guidelines also address the organisation of the AML/CFT compliance function at group level and the relationship and interactions between the AML/CFT compliance function and other functions related to the three lines of defence.

PARAGRAPH_101571: C. Baseline scenario

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:34]
PARAGRAPH_101572: 6. The current EU legislative framework for credit institutions' internal governance consists mainly of Directive 2013/36/EU, the EBA guidelines on internal governance under Directive 2013/36/EU issued in 2017, the EBA draft guidelines on internal governance under Directive 2013/36/EU issued in 2020, the EBA guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders, and the EBA guidelines on outsourcing. The draft amended guidelines on internal governance under Directive 2013/36/EU include in the section dedicated to the compliance function the provision that credit institutions should take appropriate action against internal or external behaviour that could facilitate or enable fraud, ML/TF or other financial crime and breaches of discipline.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:34]
PARAGRAPH_101573: 7. The impact assessment covers the application of the provisions included in the Level 1 text about the existence of the AML/CFT compliance officer and approval processes of senior management, and the policy options assessed during the drafting process for implementing the recommendations of the Supra National Risk Assessment reports of 2017 and 2019.

PARAGRAPH_101574: D. Options considered

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:34]
PARAGRAPH_101575: 8. In the process of drafting the guidelines, the ESAs considered whether to tackle the recommendation by updating EBA guidelines on internal governance or by issuing a new set of guidelines (approach for fulfilling the mandate). Other aspects, mainly related to the scope of the guidelines and the proportionality provisions, were discussed.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:34]
PARAGRAPH_101577: Option 1: Update guidelines on internal governance under Directive 2013/36/EU

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:34]
PARAGRAPH_101578: 9. The EBA guidelines on internal governance under Directive 2013/36/EU apply to credit institutions and investment firms as defined in point 3 of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 ('CRR I'). Similarly, the guidelines are addressed to prudential supervisors, as defined in point 40 of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/876.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:34]
PARAGRAPH_101579: 10. This option is aligned with CRR I but the scope of application of Directive (EU) 2015/849 is larger and would not be effective to address both the mandate and the effective compliance with the Directive (EU) 2015/849 provisions.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:35]
PARAGRAPH_101585: 11. Under this option, the scope of application is larger, as it will ensure the applicability of the guidelines not only to credit institutions and investment firms, but also to financial sector operators as defined in Article 4(1a) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, which are credit and financial institutions as defined in Article 3(1) and 3(2) of Directive (EU) 2015/849. Moreover, the guidelines are also applicable to competent authorities as defined in Article 4(2) (iii) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:35] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_101590: 14. Under this option, guidelines will be provided in relation to all aspects of the AML/CFT compliance function, including the role of the management body and the member of the management body or senior manager responsible for AML/CFT, as well as the organisation of the AML/CFT compliance function at group level. This option might appear to be more efficient for the addressees, as all the guidelines related to the AML/CFT compliance function would be accessible in a single document. Moreover, one single document ensures that financial sector operators comply with the Level 1 text, addresses the shortcomings identified in the Joint Opinion on ML/TF risks affecting the EU financial sector and fulfils the Commission's recommendation included in the Supra National Risk Assessment reports. Thus, it provides additional clarity to financial sector operators while maintaining the costs of implementation constant, as the costs of implementing a single set of guidelines and separate sets of guidelines would be the same.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:35]
PARAGRAPH_101591: Option 2: Provide guidelines only on the role of the AML/CFT compliance officer

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:35]
PARAGRAPH_101592: 15. This option would focus only on the aspects related to the AML/CFT compliance officer, without considering the role of the management body and the member of the management body or senior manager responsible for AML/CFT. This option is sufficient to address the recommendation of the Supra National Risk Assessment reports of 2017 and 2019. However, the EBA's guidelines should also achieve a consistent application of relevant provisions in the Level 1 text, which include several references to approval processes from senior management in charge of AML/CFT. Moreover, the 2017 Joint Opinion of the three ESAs pointed out that the most common breaches relating to inadequate controls were those about the identification and verification of financial sector operators' customers, weaknesses in the internal controls and overall AML/CFT policies and procedures and customer risk assessments.

PARAGRAPH_101596: 16. Thus, Option 2 would be more focused in addressing the Commission recommendation to draft guidelines on the functions of AML/CFT compliance officers, but it would be insufficient to strengthen financial sector operators' compliance with the Level 1 text and tackle the shortcomings identified in the Joint Opinion.

PARAGRAPH_101600: 18. Under this option, guidelines regarding the AML/CFT compliance function in financial sector operators would be drafted in general terms, without considering specific situations of those financial sector operators with limited ML/TF risk or less complex business relationships and transactions.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:36]
PARAGRAPH_101601: Option 2: Provision of sufficient guidance, in line with Directive (EU) 2015/849, for the application of the proportionality principle

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:36] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_101602: 19. . This option would include sufficient guidance to ensure that the guidelines are implemented in a proportionate manner, commensurate with the level of ML/TF risk, the size or the business model of the financial sector operator. Thus, Guideline 1 includes the first proportionality provision by prescribing the appointment of a senior manager responsible for AML/CFT where no management body is in place. Guideline 1 ensures as well that the AML/CFT policies, procedures and internal control measures are adequate and proportionate to the characteristics and the ML/TF risks. Proportionality is present in Article 8(4a) of Directive (EU) 2015/849 by envisaging, with regard to the size and nature of the business, the appointment of a separate AML/CFT compliance officer at management level. Therefore, in compliance with the Level 1 text, Guideline 2 exempts financial sector operators from the appointment of a separate AML/CFT compliance officer when the ML/TF risk is limited. However, the choice of the financial sector operators of not appointing a separate AML/CFT compliance officer does not exempt them from complying with AML/CFT obligations. Thus, the financial sector operators should allocate the related tasks to the senior manager already responsible of AML/CFT or by outsourcing certain tasks.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:36]
PARAGRAPH_101603: 20. This option will ensure full alignment with the Level 1 text and with other guidelines to which these guidelines are referenced, such as the EBA guidelines on internal governance, which apply the proportionality principle in line with Article 74(2) of Directive 2013/36/EU.

PARAGRAPH_101611: risks, both as a group and on an individual level because, in a similar way to EBA guidelines on internal governance, the guidelines are applicable to both the parent entity and the subsidiaries. Thus, the parent entity can assess the group-wide risk profile. Moreover, the guidelines strengthen the level playing field, as the guidelines are not applicable only to credit institutions but also to other types of financial sector operators, as defined in Article 4(1a) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. Financial sector operators will also benefit from the certainty introduced by the guidelines about the hierarchical structure of the AML/CFT compliance function, the responsibility for the appointment of the AML/CFT compliance officer, the tasks of and the subsequent reporting by the AML/CFT compliance officer to the management body, the content of the activity report that should be prepared by the AML/CFT compliance officer, the responsibility about customer acceptance policies and the reporting to the FIU of suspicious transactions, among other things. In sum, the guidelines would strengthen internal governance in relation to AML/CFT requirements and mitigate the level of ML/TF risk faced by the financial sector operators.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:37]
PARAGRAPH_101612: 24. In relation to the costs faced by financial sector operators, the one-off costs are limited as financial sector operators already had to be compliant with the provisions included in Directive (EU) 2015/849 related to the existence of senior management in charge of AML/CFT issues and the obligation to have policies, controls and procedures to mitigate and manage effectively the risks of ML/TF (Article 8 of Directive (EU) 2015/849), among other things. Instead, one-off costs are related to the distribution of duties between the management body, the management body or senior manager responsible for ML/TF issues and the AML/CFT compliance officer. Other one-off costs are the provision of adequate human and material resources to the AML/CFT compliance officer in order to enable effective execution of his/her duties and the preparation of AML/CFT training if necessary. The costs faced by financial sector operators are proportionate to their size, their business activities, the complexity of their transactions and level of ML/TF risk, as some financial sector operators are exempted from the appointment of a separate AML/CFT compliance officer if it is not deemed necessary. If that is the case, they should distribute the functions among already existing roles related to AML/CFT compliance within the financial sector operator.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:37] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_101613: 25. Regarding competent authorities, the benefits are related to the implementation in the EU of a harmonised hierarchical structure of the AML/CFT compliance function, particularly beneficial when performing supervisory duties. Thus, competent authorities will account with greater clarity for the tasks, the responsibilities for the preparation of the policies and procedures and reporting processes (the AML/CFT compliance officer should report to the management body via the member of the management body). Moreover, the guidelines envisage the preparation of an activity report by the AML/CFT compliance officer that can serve the competent authority in the assessment of the actions taken by the financial sector operators during the exercise. The one-off costs faced by competent authorities are expected to come from the review of the implementation of the guidelines in the first supervisory year of application while the subsequent costs are expected to come from the review of the activity report of the AML/CFT compliance officer and ensuring that it contains all the sections required by the guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:39]
PARAGRAPH_101628: On 29 July, the EBA issued a consultation on draft guidelines on policies and procedures in relation to compliance management and the role and responsibilities of the AML/CFT compliance officer. The proposed guidelines are new and are intended to complement existing guidelines e.g. the EBA guidelines on internal governance. The rationale for issuing new guidelines is the EBA's assessment that the requirements set out in Directive (EU) 2015/849 have been implemented unevenly across different sectors and Member States, and that they are not always applied effectively.

PARAGRAPH_101630: GENERAL REMARKS

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:39] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_101631: The BSG underlines the importance of ensuring that it is clear for both competent authorities and regulated firms how these guidelines relate to and can be implemented coherently alongside other guidelines on internal governance and control functions. One way to do this would be to extend existing guidelines instead of creating an additional layer. Another would be to give examples of how the different guidelines interact in practice. Without this clarity, it is more difficult for financial institutions to adhere to the guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:39]
PARAGRAPH_101632: The BSG stresses that the guidelines need to cater for the different corporate governance structures that exist in the Member States. In some countries, financial institutions have a one-layer management structure. In others, e.g. in the Nordics, financial institutions have a two-layer management structure often with a Board of Directors and an executive management team responsible for running the business. Implementing the draft guidelines could create difficulties for the two-layer management structures as it would be difficult e.g. to appoint a member of the Board of Directors to the function of member of the management body responsible for AML/CFT. It would be helpful if the EBA could clarify expectations of how the guidelines would work in practice in the common models of corporate governance.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:39]
PARAGRAPH_101633: Additionally, the BSG highlights that there is a lot of focus on the responsibilities for risk identification, but not a lot of focus on the implementation of controls that align resource to risk and focus on effective management of risk. We consider that this point should come out more clearly to complement the approach proposed in the EBA's draft guidelines on a risk-based approach to AML supervision.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:39]
PARAGRAPH_101634: The BSG believes that the proposed guidelines are quite detailed and prescriptive e.g. regarding the list of information that should be included in reports (GL 4.2), but there is a lack of detail on how the AML risk management framework should work. The BSG is of the view that approaching AML processes in a task-oriented way should be avoided and that it would be preferable to adopt a more strategic and risk-led view setting up clear guidelines/orientations on the outcomes that should be achieved, in particular in relation to governance arrangements that should be in place at group level. Furthermore, a too prescriptive approach could set a precedent for other areas, leading to a more complex and cumbersome rulebook for financial institutions that may not actually be effective in all situations in delivering good AML outcomes.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:39]
PARAGRAPH_101635: We find the use of the term 'compliance' in the draft guidelines unclear. This difficulty is compounded because the term 'compliance' is often used to refer specifically to the second line of defence. The set-up in different financial institutions can differ and some tasks that are proposed as tasks of the AML/CFT compliance officer are in some financial institutions performed by the first line of defence,

PARAGRAPH_101639: while others might be at least partly performed by internal audit as part of the third line of defence. The BSG considers that the draft guidelines do not sufficiently reflect upon the differentiation of duties between the first, second and third lines of defence and this could lead to weaknesses in the framework. An example is in section D 'Monitoring compliance' in paragraphs 45-48: how would this fit with an internal audit function? The draft guidelines are also not fully clear about how the relationship between the general compliance function and the AML/CFT compliance function should be. Should the general compliance function have an overarching role and also monitor AML/CFT compliance? Or are these two parallel, completely separate compliance streams?

PARAGRAPH_101645: The BSG considers that clarity should be given, specially where a financial services operator is part of a group, as to the type of management body structures (e.g. from a sole director to a board of directors or from dual management structures to unitary management structures) that are considered to be in the scope of application, and, on the other hand, which (if any) might be considered to be excluded (e.g. management bodies of branches, considering that these do not have legal personality). It is not clear for example whether a branch that has a management body structure should duplicate the appointments at board level (of the branch) or whether the AML/CTF compliance officer of the branch should coordinate/report directly to the group AML/CTF compliance officer, who reports directly to the member of the management body of the parent company responsible for AML/CFT.

PARAGRAPH_101661: COMMENTS ON GUIDELINE 4.1 'ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE MANAGEMENT BODY IN THE AML/CFT FRAMEWORK AND OF THE SENIOR MANAGER RESPONSIBLE FORAML/CFT'

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:41] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_101662: Regarding section 4.1, the BSG considers that the guidelines need to cater for two-layer management structures that exist in the corporate governance structure in e.g. the Nordics. It is essential to clarify whether the management body in which a member shall be appointed with responsibility for AML/CFT can be interpreted as the management leadership team and not the Board of Directors.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:41]
PARAGRAPH_101663: Likewise, one-tier management structures where the management body is conceived as one unique and inseparable body through which all functions are performed collectively would require specific mention in the EBA guidelines, related to the fact that the individual allocation of responsibilities to the management body can be only implemented if they are appropriately delegated to members of the senior management.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:41]
PARAGRAPH_101664: Additionally, it would be helpful to state more explicitly that the key responsibility of the management body is to assure itself about the effectiveness of controls in place.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:41] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_101665: In relation to the EBA's finding (reported in its 2019/2020 AML/CFT review of competent authorities' approaches to the AML/CFT supervision of banks) that AML/CFT supervisors in some Member States did not interact with financial institutions' senior management because there was no legal or regulatory requirement in those Member States to appoint an AML/CFT compliance officer at a level that was sufficiently senior to report to the financial institution's senior management body, no orientation is given as to how to address this important issue in the interests of supervisory convergence. Therefore, we consider that more clarity should be given as to what person (if any), and at what level (e.g. management level, the AML/CFT compliance officer or the group AML/CFT compliance officer), should be the person appointed/registered with the competent authority and for what purposes (reporting, contact point, etc.).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:41] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_101666: One aspect that remains important and is linked to the previous point is to clearly identify who in the organisation is ultimately responsible for the implementation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with Directive (EU) 2015/849, in particular when the financial operator is part of a group. In our opinion, the management body should bear this responsibility, but guidelines are needed in this respect, to explain that the responsibility sits in fact with them and not with the AML/CFT compliance officer (e.g. paragraph 29 of the guidelines might create confusion regarding this point).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:42]
PARAGRAPH_101671: On section 4.2.4 'Role and responsibilities of the AML/CFT compliance officer', the BSG notes that the tasks as drafted in section 4.2.4, e.g. developing ML/TF risk assessments, preparing policies and assessing training needs, could be performed by the first line of defence. In the BSG's view, it should be possible for a financial institution to set up their internal working methods, fully respecting the important task of the second line of defence (what the BSG would refer to as the 'compliance' function). Thus, the guidelines would need to allow for more flexibility in this respect.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:42] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_101672: Regarding the reporting to the management body, the BSG agrees as to the importance of such reporting and finds the list of information to be included in the activity report highly useful. However, the current drafting of the guideline is very detailed and prescriptive. This approach risks creating a tick-the-box approach to compliance. It should be possible for financial institutions and the respective management bodies to arrange their internal reporting more freely and in a way that is commensurate with their risk as long as the institution fulfils the requirements to fully understand and manage the ML/TF risks they are subject to. Moreover, as mentioned in the section above, some of the reporting may be performed by the first line of defence as described depending on the organisational set-up of the financial institution.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:42]
PARAGRAPH_101673: On 4.2.4 c) concerning customers including high-risk customers, the BSG takes the view that CDD policies and procedures could be prepared by the first line of defence although review and sign-off by the AML compliance function would be important. Moreover, while it is important to have clear decision-making policies and procedures for onboarding high-risk customers in line with the risk appetite of the financial institutions at a sufficiently high level in senior management, a requirement to have the AML/CFT compliance officer exercise an advisory role before a final decision is taken by senior management on onboarding each new high-risk customer could create an unnecessarily complex decision-making process, particularly in large financial institutions. Consideration should be given to ways of ensuring that this requirement can be implemented effectively in institutions of different sizes and complexity.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:42] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_101674: As mentioned before, there is a lot of focus on the responsibilities for risk identification, but not a lot of focus on the implementation of controls that align resource to risk and focus on effective management of risk. As an example, the BSG suggests adding into the description of compliance officer responsibilities in paras 43-44 a responsibility to ensure that simplified customer due diligence is used for lower-risk customer groups, as well as enhanced due diligence where appropriate. This would ensure a proportionate approach and avoid harming access to financial services and financial inclusion through 'over-compliance'.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:42]
PARAGRAPH_101675: The AML/CFT compliance officer should be provided with a 'name' or specific 'designation' (e.g. as the MLRO in the UK) in order to clearly differentiate this person from the member of the management body or the senior manager responsible for AML/CFT or from the compliance officer when the AML/CFT compliance officer is a different person. Otherwise, it might not be clear who is who and responsibilities might be blurred.

PARAGRAPH_101686: The BSG believes that the content of this section is too narrow. While the suitability of the individual AML/CFT compliance officer is important, it is insufficient to provide a view of the effectiveness of the AML compliance function. The BSG is of the view that the AML/CFT compliance officer's ability to deliver effective function will also depend significantly on support received from the management body and resource allocated as much as individual competence.

PARAGRAPH_101704: Where respondents raised concerns on the draft guidelines, these related to the following key issues:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:44]
PARAGRAPH_101705: 1. The legal basis of the draft guidelines and alignment with the European Commission's AML package under consultation: Several respondents questioned whether and how the draft guidelines would be aligned to provisions in the European Commission's AML package, which was published on 20 July 2021 and is currently being negotiated. In particular, Article 9 of the draft EU Regulation on AML/CFT will provide for the appointment of a 'compliance manager' as well as a 'compliance officer'.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:44]
PARAGRAPH_101706: The AML package is not yet in force and cannot therefore provide a legal basis for EBA guidelines. Furthermore, the AML package is still being negotiated and provisions may therefore change. For this reason, the EBA decided that the final guidelines will not anticipate future developments and instead remain aligned with the current legal framework and, in particular, provisions of Directive (EU) 2015/849.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:45]
PARAGRAPH_101712: The EBA, in consultation with the EBA's internal governance experts, concluded that the draft guidelines should not advocate for any specific governance structure or organisational set-up of financial institutions. The EBA updated the guidelines to make this point clear.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:45]
PARAGRAPH_101713: 3. Drafting style, length and level of detail provided by the guidelines: Most respondents considered that the draft guidelines were too prescriptive. In their view, the level of detail provided risked leading to a tick-box approach by credit and financial institutions, rather than a risk-based approach. They also considered that very detailed guidelines would set a precedent for other areas of the EBA's work, leading to a complex and lengthy rulebook for financial institutions. Lastly, several respondents considered that the level of operational details on the roles and responsibilities of the AML compliance officer was not proportionate to his/her level of hierarchy in the financial institution.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:45]

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:47]
PARAGRAPH_101751: Five respondents questioned why the guidelines refer to the approval of policies, controls and procedures by the 'management body' instead of the 'senior manager' which would be coherent with the language of Directive (EU) 2015/849.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:47] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_101752: Directive (EU) 2015/849, under its Article 8(5), requires entities to 'obtain approval from their senior management for the policies, controls and procedures that they put in place and to monitor and enhance the measures taken, where appropriate.' There was no consensus to refer to the 'management body' (instead of 'senior management') in the guidelines for such approval. In order to avoid a pure repetition of Directive (EU) 2015/849 language the whole section was subsequently deleted from the final version of the guidelines.

PARAGRAPH_101755: One respondent indicated that the management body in its supervisory function is not responsible for setting nor approving an adequate and effective internal governance and internal control framework to ensure compliance with AML/CFT requirements. Its function is to ensure and assess the effectiveness of such a framework.

PARAGRAPH_101759: Some respondents questioned how the management body would be able to 'collectively possess adequate knowledge, skills' in general, and such collective knowledge 'to understand the ML/TF risks' in particular given the specificities of the AML/CFT field.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:47]
PARAGRAPH_101760: Collective knowledge is foreseen under CRD and further specified in the joint ESMA and EBA fit and proper guidelines. The collective knowledge means that the management body should have collectively the knowledge and skills to understand the AML-CFT framework. It does not mean that each individual member of the management body should be an expert in all subject areas such as AML/CFT.

PARAGRAPH_101786: The 'approval' of the AML/CFT compliance officer's report would include the possibility of 'rejecting' the report, which could undermine the AML/CFT compliance officer's independence. The EBA accepts the point raised. However, the mere 'acknowledgment of the receipt' of such a report would not be sufficient, it should be given consideration by the management body.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:49]
PARAGRAPH_101793: Some respondents argued that in certain governance models (i.e. one-tier systems) whereby the management body is conceived as one, inseparable collegial body, it is not feasible to appoint one single person as responsible for AML/CFT.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:49]
PARAGRAPH_101794: The EBA notes that the same argument was already put forward during the public consultation on the revision of the EBA's guidelines on internal governance, published in July 202132. In that context, it had already been clarified that appointing one person as AML/CFT responsible is operationally feasible and this is without prejudice to the responsibility of the management body as a collegial body.

PARAGRAPH_101797: Several respondents challenged that in financial institutions with one-tier governance systems the designated member of the management body in its management function responsible for AML/CFT will be the CEO himself/herself. Therefore, in such cases, the CEO would not possess the required experience and skill regarding AML/CFT and therefore expectations described under paragraph 17 are unrealistic.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:50] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_101808: Some respondents indicated that the guidelines should focus on the AML/CTF compliance function specifying its tasks and responsibilities and establishing that an AML/CTF compliance officer responsible for the function shall be appointed. Consequently, these respondents suggested referring, systematically, to the 'AML/CTF compliance function' instead of the 'AML/CTF compliance officer'. They believed this would also be consistent with the forthcoming draft EU AML/CFT regulation, which is part of the European Commission's AML/CFT package, still under negotiations as of May 2022.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:50] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_101809: The guidelines are based on Directive (EU) 2015/849 and therefore should be aligned to Directive (EU) 2015/849 language. See also section 5.4. of the Final report for further clarification.

PARAGRAPH_101811: Guideline 4.2, paragraph 28

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:50]
PARAGRAPH_101812: Lots of respondents reacted to the mention that the AML/CFT compliance officer should 'normally be located and work in the country in which the credit or financial institution is established'. These respondents, who request introducing more flexibility in this specific guideline, made reference to 1. the specific COVID19-context (which has brought a more generalised manner of working from home - as opposed to working in physical offices) but also to 2. the potential outsourcing arrangements that may be in place for the financial institution which would not necessarily require physical presence of the service provider in the same country as the credit or financial institution.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:50]
PARAGRAPH_101813: The intention of this paragraph is not to prescribe where the AML/CFT compliance officer should be living but note that certain national legislation may require, for instance, that the compliance officer in charge of filing STRs be located in the same country as the financial institution. Also, the majority of the national regulators require that such a compliance officer, whose name is reported to national competent authorities, be 'available' upon request from the regulator and therefore should be localised in a limited distance from the financial institution's offices. In addition, paragraph 28 should be read together with paragraph 29 of the guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:50]
PARAGRAPH_101817: The word 'separate' refers to 'different from the member of the management body responsible for AML/CFT' (section 4.1.3) or the senior manager responsible for AML/CFT where no management body is in place (section 4.1.4). Appointment of a 'separate' AML/CFT compliance officer should be based on the proportionality criteria as set out in section 4.2.2.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:50]
PARAGRAPH_101821: The EBA is of the view that if an AML/CFT compliance officer is fulfilling such a position in several entities at the same time, it is important that those entities belong to the same group as he/she will need to carry out the work in an efficient manner; in the context of a group, the same group policy is to be applied in the different entities.

PARAGRAPH_101851: Some respondents indicated that AML/CFT compliance officer does not necessarily have to train the staff himself/herself, but can delegate this task. They requested to acknowledge this in the guidelines.

PARAGRAPH_101852: The AML/CFT compliance officer will not need to be personally involved in each training, and this is already reflected in the choice of the term 'oversee' (and not 'deliver') in paragraph 56. More generally, the AML/CFT compliance officer can have dedicated staff/employees working under his/her direction.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:52] [RISK:OPERATIONAL_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_101863: A large number of respondents challenged the list of non- outsourceable strategic decisions as indicated in paragraph 68. Several respondents also questioned the principle that intra- group outsourcing should be subject to the same regulatory framework as outsourcing to service providers outside the group. They argue that outsourcing outside of a group bears higher risk (e.g. operational risk).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:52]
PARAGRAPH_101864: The ESAs guidelines on outsourcing set out key principles of the outsourcing arrangements which remain valid in the context of the outsourcing of operational functions of the AML/CFT compliance officer. The guidelines have been further clarified.

PARAGRAPH_101867: One respondent specifically requested that the inventory of intra-group AML/CFT outsourcing should be established and kept by the concerned entity which is outsourcing (as opposed to the parent company). This is to ease the burden on the parent entity.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:52]
PARAGRAPH_101868: Agreement that the inventory of intra-group AML/CFT outsourcing should be kept by the outsourcing entity, as this thinking is also aligned with the principle that the responsibility of outsourcing remains with the entity. Such an inventory should be made available to the parent company for its consultation.

PARAGRAPH_101876: Guideline 4.3

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:53]
PARAGRAPH_101877: Several respondents requested clarification on how the whole of section 4.3 of the guidelines would be applicable to cross-border groups whereby the parent entity is not an obliged entity under Directive (EU) 2015/849 either because of the parent entity's legal form (e.g. holding company) or because the parent entity is established in a third country outside Europe.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:53]
PARAGRAPH_101878: These guidelines are based on Directive (EU) 2015/849. It was therefore clarified that where a parent company is not an obliged entity under Directive (EU) 2015/849, section 4.3 should not be applicable to the parent entity (note, however, that branches and subsidiaries of such a parent entity which are themselves obliged entities, if located in the Member States, should be compliant with other sections of these guidelines).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:53]
PARAGRAPH_101879: Change introduced in paragraph 77 to make the scope of application explicit and clear.

PARAGRAPH_101881: One respondent requested clarifications on how the cartography of risks exercise at a group level should be coordinated with the individual entities' risk assessments.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:53]
PARAGRAPH_101882: It is the responsibility of the individual entities to perform their own AML/CFT risk assessments, but the parent entity's responsibility to provide a consistent methodology.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:53]
PARAGRAPH_101883: Change introduced to paragraph 77.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:53]
PARAGRAPH_101884: Guideline 4.3.3, paragraph 79 a)

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:53]
PARAGRAPH_101885: One respondent requested clarification as to whether, in banking groups where the AML/CFT function is outsourced to the parent company, the member of the management body responsible for AML/CFT should be appointed only at the parent company level or in each entity of the group, both located in the same Member State as the parent company or in another Member State / third countries, including non-banking entities subject to AML/CFT regulation.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:53]
PARAGRAPH_101886: There needs to be a designation of a member of the management body responsible for AML/CFT in every subsidiary/entity of the group. An AML/CFT responsible at the group level is not sufficient. This requirement is also coherent with section 4.1 of these guidelines.

PARAGRAPH_101892: Guideline 4.3.3, paragraph 81

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:53]
PARAGRAPH_101893: One respondent proposed to add a requirement, in the list of tasks of the group AML/CFT compliance officer under paragraph 81, that the group AML/CFT compliance officer should be involved in the recruitment and/or replacement of the AML/CFT compliance officers in the entities of the group.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:53]
PARAGRAPH_101894: The systematic involvement of the group-level AML/CFT compliance officer in the designation of AML/CFT compliance officers of the group entities is not a Directive (EU) 2015/849 requirement and may pose several implementation issues such as: the shift of responsibility for the selection of the candidate from the entity toward the group; legal issues around the contractualisation of the employment; and, in cases of bigger financial institutions with a large number of entities in the group, operational/resource issues for the group AML/CFT compliance officer to find time to allocate to this task.

PARAGRAPH_101897: Guideline 4.3.3, paragraph 82

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:54] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_101898: Several respondents indicated that the list of elements to be included in the activity report of the group AML/CFT compliance officer, as described under paragraph 82, is excessive, too prescriptive and detailed, and sometimes 'create confusion' between the tasks of the first and second lines of defence.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:54] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_101899: As was the case with paragraph 50 on the activity report of the AML/CFT compliance officer, this specific part of the guidelines has been significantly revised and shortened.
