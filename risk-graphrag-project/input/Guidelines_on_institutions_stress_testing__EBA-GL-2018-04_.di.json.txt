[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_106768: These guidelines aim to achieve convergence of the practices followed by institutions for stress testing across the EU. They provide detailed guidance to be complied with by institutions when designing and conducting a stress testing programme/framework. The EBA issues these guidelines to update and replace the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) Guidelines on stress testing (GL32), which will be repealed after the revised guidelines have entered into force.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_106769: These guidelines take into account the conclusions of the peer review of the implementation of GL32.

PARAGRAPH_106770: The guidelines establish and develop the following concepts: the taxonomy of stress testing; the description of types of stress test exercises; the reverse stress testing process for both regular stress testing and recovery planning purposes; and additional issues that have gained importance in the stress testing programme and need to be incorporated and properly defined, such as conduct- related risk and litigation costs, foreign exchange risk, interaction between solvency stress tests and liquidity stress tests, business models and data aggregation.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_106771: These guidelines recognise the principle of proportionality (see section 4.5) in both the quantitative and the qualitative aspects of stress testing: small and less complex institutions may focus more on the qualitative aspects while more sophisticated stress testing techniques are required of larger or more complex institutions. Stress testing requires a certain frequency to be a meaningful part of an institution's risk management framework. Such frequency should be determined having regard not only to the scope and type of the stress test but also to the nature, scale, size and complexity of the institution's activities (proportionality principle), among other aspects. Moreover, regarding scope and coverage, stress tests should capture risks at various levels in an institution. In this regard, according to the proportionality principle, the scope of stress testing may vary from simple portfolio level sensitivity or individual risk level analyses to comprehensive institution-wide scenario stress testing.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_106772: The EBA launched a first consultation on its draft guidelines during the first quarter of 2016 and received 12 responses to the draft guidelines. The EBA assessed all the main arguments presented in the responses, with a view to deciding on whether or not amendments were required before issuing the final guidelines. The result of this assessment is presented in an extensive feedback section.

PARAGRAPH_106773: In April 2017, the EBA issued a roadmap outlining its plans to update the common European framework for the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) in 2017-2018. Given the close links between Pillar 2 Guidance (P2G) and wider aspects of supervisory stress testing (e.g. the specification of what forms of supervisory stress testing can be used to set or update P2G), the revision of the SREP guidelines also incorporated elements from the first draft of the stress testing guidelines, in particular section 5, 'Supervisory assessment of institutions stress testing'; section 6, 'Supervisory stress testing'; and section 7, 'Use of quantitative results for capital adequacy assessment purposes', which were also reviewed to reflect comments received in the public

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_106785: The EBA is mandated to foster sound and effective supervision across the EU arising from the requirements specified in Directive 2013/36/EU and more generally from its obligations under its founding regulation (Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, the EBA Regulation).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_106786: The relevant provisions legally supporting the issuance of the revised guidelines are the provisions of Article 16 of the EBA Regulation and the relevant principles set out in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Directive 2013/36/EU.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_106787: Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 provides that the EBA shall, with a view to establishing consistent, efficient and effective supervisory practices within the European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS), and to ensuring the common, uniform and consistent application of Union law, issue guidelines and recommendations addressed to competent authorities or financial institutions.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5] [RISK:LIQUIDITY_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_106788: Institutions are required to take a forward-looking view in their risk management, strategic planning, capital planning and liquidity planning as part of their internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) required by Article 73 of Directive 2013/36/EU. One of the tools that institutions can use to facilitate this forward-looking perspective in risk management is stress testing.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_106789: Since 2010, when the CEBS Guidelines on stress testing (GL32) were issued, there have been a number of developments in stress testing with regard to its methodologies and usage. The financial crisis and several negative events in the financial sector since 2010 have highlighted significant lessons in relation to stress testing practices. Supervisory expectations in relation to institutions' stress testing practices have changed in light of this recent experience both within and beyond the EU. Several important conclusions were drawn from the 2013 EBA peer review on the implementation of the stress testing guidelines. The aim of the peer review performed by the EBA was to assess and compare the effectiveness of the supervisory activities related to the review of credit institutions' own stress testing programmes/frameworks across the EU, as well as the implementation of related provisions by competent authorities1. In particular the results of the peer review suggested that all competent authorities' organisational and resource models had benefits; however, irrespective of the model, dedicated technical experts in stress testing should have been involved. Competent authorities have often focused on the largest institutions in their respective jurisdictions, and devoted far less attention to other institutions. Very few competent authorities required reverse stress testing, and, when they did, it was often only as part of recovery planning. Moreover, the incorporation of the outcomes of stress testing into the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) and the joint decision process on institution-specific prudential requirements for cross-border groups was handled differently across jurisdictions. Many of the competent authorities assessments have shown evidence of substantial work on top-down stress testing, from both a micro- and a macroprudential perspective.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_106790: For example, in many instances, competent authorities observed that stress testing was not sufficiently integrated into the institutions' risk management frameworks or senior management decision-making. In general, where stress testing was used, scenarios continued to be insufficiently severe. In other

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_106797: These guidelines aim to address deficiencies identified in the EBA peer review, and will assist institutions in understanding the supervisory expectations of appropriate stress testing governance and infrastructure, and also cover the use of stress testing as a risk management tool. These guidelines are designed to identify the relevant building blocks required for an effective stress testing programme, from simple sensitivity analysis on single risk factors or portfolios to complex macroeconomic scenario stress testing on an institution-wide basis.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_106798: While institutions' stress testing is a risk management tool that has been used for a long time, there remains substantial ambiguity and overlap in several terms and definitions. These guidelines, therefore, provide a taxonomy.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_106799: In addition, in recent years, some issues have gained importance in stress testing programmes and need to be incorporated and properly defined, such as the role of reverse stress testing in recovery planning. Moreover, new individual risk categories are covered. Furthermore, business models, data aggregation, the links between solvency stress tests and liquidity stress tests, and other concepts have been updated, as GL32, issued in 2010, have become outdated and do not reflect best industry practices.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_106800: The institutions' stress testing section focuses on the overarching principles of governance including: (a) stress testing governance structures and their use, including the application of the SREP guidelines on the internal governance of stress testing; (b) data infrastructure, in particular data aggregation capabilities and reporting practices; (c) stress testing scope and coverage, taking into account a multi- layered approach, from simple portfolio level and individual risk level stress testing to comprehensive institution-wide stress testing; (d) possible methodologies considering the importance of undertaking both simple sensitivity analyses and more complex scenario stress testing and the severity of scenarios, and highlighting the importance of qualitative and quantitative approaches to reverse stress testing; (e) a range of, non-exhaustive, individual risk categories that should be taken into account in relation to stress testing with the aim of enhancing risk management and capital planning and liquidity processes; and (f) the application of stress testing programmes, including in relation to the interaction between the outputs of stress tests and management actions and the application for recovery and resolution purposes, and the use of stress tests to assess the viability of an institution's capital plan in adverse circumstances in the context of ICAAP and the internal liquidity adequacy assessment process (ILAAP).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_106801: The principle of proportionality applies to all aspects of these guidelines, including the methodology, as well as the frequency and the degree of detail of the stress tests. These guidelines also recognise the principle of proportionality by describing both quantitative and qualitative aspects of stress testing. Examples of proportionality are provided in some sections in relation to applying these guidelines to institutions of different natures, sizes, complexities and business models, as appropriate.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_106802: The proportionality principle is invoked in these guidelines to discuss the level of sophistication of the stress testing methodologies, practices and infrastructure required in relation to the size, structure and internal organisation (also taking into account the nature, scope and complexity of activities) of an institution. In addition, competent authorities should apply the guidelines taking into account the

PARAGRAPH_106807: Thus, these guidelines are applicable in their entirety to Category 1 (systemically important) institutions. Category 2 (less or non-systemic) institutions' compliance with the guidelines depends on their nature, scale and size, and the features and complexity of their activities; particular attention is paid to their domestic or cross-border activities, and the simple or multiple business line nature of their activities, characteristics that need to be reflected in their stress testing.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_106808: For Category 3 and 4 institutions (small and medium-sized institutions), the guidance provided in these guidelines must be followed to the extent that it is proportionate and relevant to their activities, resources and the risk posed to the financial system. The scope of stress testing for these institutions reflects the reduced scope of their activities and the limited risk to the system overall.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_106809: Proportionality criteria should also apply to portfolio level stress tests based on the complexity and relative size of the portfolio under consideration. To decide which portfolios need portfolio stress tests, the overall risk situation should also be taken into account. Nevertheless, no portfolio can be left out when assessing the overall risk situation or conducting a combined stress test, as relatively small risks in less important portfolios may amount to an important risk when addressing the whole institution.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:24]
PARAGRAPH_107043: 48. Stress tests should capture risks at various levels in an institution. In this regard, according to the proportionality principle, the scope of stress testing may vary from simple portfolio level sensitivity or individual risk level analyses to comprehensive institution-wide scenario stress testing.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:24]
PARAGRAPH_107044: 49. Stress tests should take into account changes in correlations between risk types and risk factors, at individual entity and at a group-wide level. They should also take into account that correlations tend to increase during times of economic or financial distress and that case-by- case analyses of how certain correlations behave in certain scenarios are required.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:24]
PARAGRAPH_107046: 50. Institutions should perform stress tests on an individual portfolio basis, covering all risk types that affect these portfolios, using both sensitivity and scenario analyses. Institutions should also identify risk factors and their adequate level of stress, wherever possible, at the level of an individual portfolio.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:24] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_107047: 51. Institutions should ensure that they stress test portfolios and business lines or units to identify intra- and inter-risk concentrations - i.e. concentrations of common risk factors within and across risk types (including contagion effects).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:24] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_107048: 52. In particular, when considering inter-risk concentrations, institutions should aggregate across risk types notably market and credit risk, to gain a better understanding of their potential risk concentrations in a stress situation. Institutions should identify potential links between exposures that could be risky during periods of economic or financial distress, as well as question assumptions about dependencies and correlations between risk types in a stress situation.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:25] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_107062: 57. Institutions should take into account their size and internal organisation, and the nature, scale and complexity of their activities when developing and implementing a stress testing programme. Significant institutions and more complex institutions, including at consolidated level, should have more sophisticated stress testing programmes, while small and less complex institutions and groups (consolidated level) may implement simpler stress testing programmes.

PARAGRAPH_107135: 82. Institutions should ensure that their scenarios assess absolute and relative changes of risk factors. In an absolute scenario, the degree of severity should be a direct change of the risk factor and not depend on the current level. In a relative scenario, the degree of severity should depend on the current level and economic situation (e.g. GDP growth decreases by 2%, i.e. a relative change to the absolute level). For example, will a 2% negative relative change in GDP from a starting point with a substantial positive output gap (i.e. current GDP is substantially above the structural GDP) not necessarily lead to a severe stress effect on GDP in absolute/level terms. Likewise, the worse the current economic situation at the outset the more severe the stress of a relative scenario. Institutions should ensure that their choice of the scenario is sufficiently severe in both relative and absolute terms. Both the choice and its impact on the degree of severity should be justified and documented.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:30]

PARAGRAPH_107139: 84. Institutions should perform adequate reverse stress tests as part of the stress testing programme, sharing the same governance, an effective infrastructure and quality standards, and to complement other types of stress testing, taking into account the nature, size, scale and complexity of their business activities and risks. Small and less complex institutions may focus more on the qualitative aspects of reverse stress testing while more sophisticated reverse stress testing techniques are required of larger or more complex institutions. The reverse stress testing should be clearly defined in terms of responsibilities and resources allocated and should be supported by an infrastructure that is suitable and flexible and by written policies and procedures. Reverse stress testing should be carried out regularly by all types of institutions and at the same level of application as ICAAP and ILAAP (e.g. institution wide and covering all relevant risk types).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:30] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_107140: 85. Institutions should include scenarios identified through the reverse stress testing to complement the range of stress test scenarios they undertake and, for comparison purposes, in order to assess the overall severity, allowing the identification of severe but still plausible scenarios.

PARAGRAPH_107146: 87. Institutions should use reverse stress testing as a regular risk management tool in order to improve their awareness of current and potential vulnerabilities, providing added value to institutions' risk management. The principle of proportionality applies to all aspects of the use of reverse stress testing. Institutions should also consider that the pre-defined outcome of reverse stress testing can be produced by circumstances other than the circumstance analysed in the stress test.

Institutions should use reverse stress testing in planning and decision-making and to challenge their business models and strategies in order to identify and analyse what could possibly cause their business models to become unviable, such as the assessment of both the ability to generate returns over the following months and the sustainability of the strategy to generate returns over a longer period based on strategic plans and financial forecasts. The engagement of the management body and senior management throughout the process is expected.

PARAGRAPH_107153: 90. Where reverse stress testing reveals that an institution's risk of business model failure is unacceptably high and inconsistent with its risk appetite, the institution should plan measures to prevent or mitigate such risk, taking into account the time that the institution should have to react to these events and implement those measures. As part of these measures, the institution should consider if changes to its business model are required. These measures derived from reverse stress testing, including any changes to the institution's business plan, should be documented in detail in the institution's ICAAP documentation.

Institutions using internal models for credit risk, counterparty credit risk and market risk, when carrying out reverse stress testing in accordance with Articles 177, 290(8) and 368(1)(g) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, should endeavour to identify severe, but plausible, scenarios that could result in significant adverse outcomes and potentially challenge an institution's overall viability. Institutions should see these reverse stress tests as an essential complement to their internal models for calculating capital requirements and as a regular risk management tool for revealing the possible inadequacies of these internal models. In severe stress scenarios, even though this should not necessarily be taken as an indication that the modelling of the inputs into the IRB formula are inadequate, model risk will increase and may lead to a breakdown in the model's predictability.

Institutions should perform qualitative analyses in developing a well-defined narrative of the reverse stress testing and a clear understanding of its feedback and non-linear effects, taking into account the dynamics of risk, and combinations of and interactions between and across risk types. When developing a well-defined narrative, an institution should consider external exogenous events such as economic events, an industry crash, political events, litigation cases and natural events, as well as risk factors such as operational risks, concentration and correlations, reputational risks and loss of confidence, and combinations of these events and factors. The proper engagement of the management body of the institution in the discussions of the narrative is fundamental, taking into account possible specific vulnerabilities and the impact on the whole institution.

Institutions should perform quantitative and more sophisticated analyses, taking into account the institution's size as well as the nature, scale, complexity and riskiness of its business activities, in setting out specific loss levels or other negative impacts on its capital, liquidity (e.g. the access to funding, in particular to increases in funding costs) or overall financial position. Institutions should work backwards in a quantitative manner to identify the risk factors, and the required amplitude of changes, that could cause such a loss or negative impact (e.g. defining the appropriate loss level or some other measure of interest on the balance sheet of the financial institution such as capital ratios or funding resources). Institutions should understand and document in detail the drivers of risk (e.g. outputting the exact factor draws that had the most impact on the portfolio tail region), the key business lines and a clear and consistent narrative around weaknesses and the corresponding scenarios (e.g. about the underlying assumptions and sensitivity of the results to those assumptions over time) that cause the pre-defined outcomes and the events chain and the likely flow through (e.g. the most important factors may be mapped to macroeconomic variables according to the combinations for a given target loss/capital in a portfolio), identifying hidden vulnerabilities (e.g. hidden correlations and concentrations) and overlapping effects.

However, an institution should not primarily use a sensitivity analysis and simple metrics to identify the scenario relevant for the reverse stress test. The qualitative analysis should lead to the identification of the relevant scenario, combining expert judgement from different business areas, as thinking might be the most effective way to prevent a business model failure. A joint stressing of all relevant risk parameters using statistical aspects (e.g. volatility of risk factors consistent with historical observations supplemented with hypothetical but plausible assumptions) should be developed. The plausibility of the parameter shifts required to reach the pre-defined outcome gives a first idea about possible vulnerabilities in the institution. To assess the plausibility, historical (multivariate) probability distributions - adjusted, where deemed necessary, according to expert judgements - should, inter alia, be applied. Qualitative analyses and assessments, combining expert judgements from different business areas, should guide the identification of relevant scenarios.

Institutions should use reverse stress testing as a tool to gather insights into scenarios that involve combinations of solvency and liquidity stresses, where traditional modelling may fail to capture complex aspects from real situations. Institutions should use reverse stress testing to challenge their capital plans and liquidity plans. Where appropriate, institutions should identify and analyse situations that could aggravate a liquidity stress event and transform it into a solvency stress event, and vice versa, and eventually to a business failure. Institutions should endeavour to apply reverse stress testing in an integrated manner for risks to capital or liquidity with a view to improving the understanding and the management of related risks in extreme situations.

Institutions should develop scenarios of severe macroeconomic and financial distress, varying in their severity (including system-wide events, legal entity-specific stress and group-wide stress), to be used in recovery plans under Article 5(6) of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and EBA/GL/2014/06, and use specific reverse stress testing to develop 'near- default' scenarios (institution close to failure but no further) and as an input to inform and test the efficiency and effectiveness of their recovery actions and their recovery planning, and analyse sensitivities around corresponding assumptions. Such 'near-default' scenarios should identify and describe the point that would lead an institution's or a group's business model to become non-viable unless the recovery actions were successfully implemented. The scenarios should allow the estimation of results and the suitability of all the available recovery options. The terminology used in the description of recovery scenarios should help to determine which recovery options were tested under particular stress scenarios. The description should have a sufficient level of detail, through both a set of quantitative assumptions and a qualitative narrative, in order to determine whether or not the scenario is relevant for the institution and how severe it is. The events should be described in a logical sequence and the assumptions underlying the main drivers (e.g. net income, risk-weighted assets (RWAs), capital) should be laid down very clearly.

PARAGRAPH_107194: 106. Institutions should endeavour to determine specific risk factors and set out, on a preliminary basis, how these factors can affect their total credit risk losses and capital requirements. Institutions should endeavour to make that determination on an exposure class by exposure class basis (e.g. factors relevant to mortgages may be different from those relevant to corporate asset classes).

PARAGRAPH_107195: 107. Institutions should ensure that credit risk is assessed at various levels of shock scenarios, from simple sensitivity analyses to institution-wide stress tests, or to group-wide stress tests, in particular:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:35]
PARAGRAPH_107196: a) market-wide shock scenarios (e.g. a sharp slowdown of the economy that affects portfolio quality for all of the creditors);

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:35]
PARAGRAPH_107200: 108. Institutions should subject risk factors to sensitivity analyses, which in turn should provide quantitative background information for the design of scenarios.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:35]
PARAGRAPH_107201: 109. Institutions should apply different time horizons when applying their stress scenarios. The time horizon should range from overnight (one-off effects) up to longer terms (e.g. a creeping economic downturn).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:35]
PARAGRAPH_107202: 110. When stress testing financial collateral values, institutions should identify conditions that would adversely affect the realisable value of their collateral positions including deterioration in the credit quality of collateral issuers or market illiquidity.

PARAGRAPH_107208: 113. Institutions should consider, wherever possible, the following relevant parameters: PD, LGD, EAD, expected loss (EL) and risk exposure amount, and the impact on credit losses and own funds requirements.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:36] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_107209: 114. For the estimation of future losses in stress tests, institutions should, where appropriate, rely on credit risk parameters different from the ones applied in the calculation of capital requirements, which are usually through-the-cycle or hybrid parameters (a combination of through-the-cycle and point-in-time parameters) for PD and under downturn conditions for LGD. In particular, institutions should, where relevant, apply estimates based on point-in-time parameters in accordance with the severity of the scenario for the purpose of estimating credit losses.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:36]
PARAGRAPH_107210: 115. For the computation of EAD, an institution should also consider a credit conversion factor (CCF) and, in particular, the effect of the institution's legal capacity to unilaterally cancel undrawn amounts of committed credit facilities especially in stressed conditions.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:36] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_107211: 116. Institutions should apply, to the extent appropriate, credit risk internal model approaches that challenge historical relations and data, and simulations of credit quality migrations among categories of exposures to provide an estimate of losses.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:36]
PARAGRAPH_107212: 117. When assessing their risk to leveraged counterparties or shadow banking entities, institutions should take into account risk concentrations and they should not presume the existence of collateral or continuous re-margining agreements, which may not be available in case of severe market shocks. Institutions should endeavour to capture such correlated tail risks adequately.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:36]
PARAGRAPH_107214: 118. Institutions should take into account securitisation risks that arise from structured credit products, usually created by repackaging the cash flow from a pool of assets into various tranches or asset-backed securities, taking into account the different positions that institutions can have in the securitisation process, by acting as originator, sponsor or investor.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:36] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_107215: 119. Institutions should ensure that the stress testing of securitised assets addresses the credit risk of the underlying pool of assets, including the default risk, the possibly non-linear and dynamic default correlations as well as the evolution of the collateral values. Institutions should take into account all relevant information with regard to the specific structure of each securitisation, such as the seniority of the tranche, the thickness of the tranche, credit enhancements and granularity, expressed in terms of the effective number of exposures.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:36]
PARAGRAPH_107216: 120. The sensitivity to systemic market effects, affecting, for example, liquidity dry-outs or increasing asset correlations, on all levels of the structured product should be carefully taken into account. In addition, the effect of reputational risks, resulting in, for example, funding issues, should be assessed.

PARAGRAPH_107221: 121. Stress tests should address all relevant contractual arrangements, the potential impact of embedded triggers (e.g. early amortisation provisions), the leverage of the securitisation structure and the liquidity/funding risks arising from the structure (i.e. cash-flow mismatches and prepayment conditions including in relation to interest rate changes).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:37]
PARAGRAPH_107222: 22. Scenarios should also consider the default of one or more of the contractual counterparties involved in the securitisation structure, especially of those acting as guarantors of certain tranches.

PARAGRAPH_107223: 123. 3. If the institution relies on external ratings to assess the risk of securitised products, the external ratings should be critically reviewed and scenarios stressing the ratings including the rating classes' specific impairment rates should be assessed, e.g. by stressing (historical) rating transition matrices.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:37]
PARAGRAPH_107224: 124. When designing the stress testing approach, institutions should consider the following:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:37]
PARAGRAPH_107225: a) the impacts of stress tests for structured credit products will materialise on the level of the asset pool in increased defaults (or PDs and LGDs, where applicable) and hence increased expected loss/impairment rates and regulatory capital requirements (as well as increased probabilities for downgrades) should be expected during shocks; and

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:37]
PARAGRAPH_107226: b) that further impacts may arise from decreases in the net cash flow, increases in trading losses and value adjustments, or from the deterioration of regulatory metrics such as the net stable funding ratio.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:37] [RISK:MARKET_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_107228: 125. Institutions should take into account market risk, notably risks derived from losses resulting from adverse changes in the value of positions arising from movements in market prices across commodity, credit, equity, foreign exchange and interest rate risk factors. Interest rate risks in trading book positions should be considered by institutions as a component of market risk.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:37] [RISK:MARKET_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_107229: 126. Institutions should conduct stress tests for their positions in financial instruments in trading and fair value reported in other comprehensive income (FVOCI) portfolios (i.e. accounting terms to classify financial assets), including securitisation instruments/positions and covered bonds. These stress tests should be undertaken as part of institution-wide stress testing as well as for market risk management and calculation purposes.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:37] [RISK:LIQUIDITY_RISK] [RISK:MARKET_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_107230: 27. Institutions should apply a range of severe but plausible scenarios for all positions referred to in the previous paragraph, e.g. exceptional changes in market prices, shortages of liquidity in the markets and the defaulting of large market participants. Dependencies and correlations between different markets and, consequently, adverse changes in correlations should, where appropriate, also be taken into account and factored in. The impact on accounting credit value adjustment (CVA) and on reserves related to institutions' portfolios (e.g. reserves for liquidity, for modelling uncertainties) should be taken into account equally in stress tests. Market risk reserve stress testing should be substantiated.

PARAGRAPH_107234: 128. When calibrating these stress tests, institutions should take into account at least the nature and characteristics of their portfolios and related financial instruments (e.g. vanilla/exotic products, liquidity, maturity), their trading strategies, and the possibility of, associated cost of and potential time involved in hedging out or managing risks under severe market conditions.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:38] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_107235: 129. . As instruments and trading strategies change over time, institutions should ensure that their stress tests evolve to accommodate those changes.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:38]
PARAGRAPH_107236: 130. Institutions should develop an appropriate approach to capturing the underestimation of tail risk by historical data (fat tails) where applicable, e.g. by applying severe hypothetical scenarios, and, where risk is assessed against percentile confidence levels, should consider tail events beyond those confidence levels.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:38]
PARAGRAPH_107237: 131. Institutions should in particular:

PARAGRAPH_107238: a) assess the consequences of major market disturbances and identify plausible situations that could entail extraordinarily high losses, which should, where appropriate, also include events with a low probability for all main risk types, especially the various components of market risks; for portfolio level stress tests, the effects of adverse changes to correlations might be explored; and mitigating effects of management actions may be taken into account if they are based on plausible assumptions about market liquidity; and

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:38]
PARAGRAPH_107239: b) have in place a list of the measures containing limits and other possible actions taken to reduce risks and preserve own funds; in particular, limits on exchange rate, interest rate, equity price and commodity price risks set by institutions should, where appropriate, be taken into account against the results of the stress testing calculations.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:38] [RISK:OPERATIONAL_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_107241: 132. Institutions should be aware that relevant risk parameters related to operational risk may derive from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, including legal risks, or from external events, and may affect all products and activities within the institution.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:38] [RISK:OPERATIONAL_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_107242: 133. . In order to stress relevant risk parameters, institutions should use the profit and loss (P&L) effect of operational losses as the main metric. Any intrinsic impact caused by the operational risk event should be considered as an operational risk loss (e.g. intrinsic impacts from opportunity costs, or internal costs such as overtime/bonuses, etc., where they relate to an operational risk event). In addition, and only for the purpose of stress testing, any loss of future earnings caused by operational risk events (excluding second-line effects on the macroeconomic environment) should be included. At least the institutions under the advanced measurement approach (AMA) should also take these losses into account as they flow into the internal loss database to calculate the additional capital requirements. When using historical data, external data or scenarios as inputs for both P&L and RWA projections, institutions should take into account and avoid possible double-counting effects on the input side.

PARAGRAPH_107246: 134. As operational losses may induce second-round effects (i.e. reputational risk), in order to account for such effects, the operational risk stress testing programme should be thoroughly integrated into the institution-wide stress test and should include interconnections with liquidity and own funds requirements.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:42]
PARAGRAPH_107313: 154. Institutions should apply the following three types of stress scenarios: an idiosyncratic scenario, a market-wide scenario and a combination of the two. As idiosyncratic stress scenario should assume institution-specific events (e.g. a rating downgrade, the default of the largest funding counterparty, a loss of market access, a loss of currency convertibility, the default of the counterparty providing the largest inflows), whereas a market-wide stress scenario should assume an impact on a group of institutions or the financial sector as a whole (e.g. a deterioration in funding market conditions or the macroeconomic environment, or rating downgrades of countries in which the institution operates).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:42]
PARAGRAPH_107314: 155. Institutions should design different time horizons in their stress testing: the time horizons should range from overnight up to at least 12 months; there should also be separate stress tests relating to intraday liquidity risks. The time horizon should display, for example, a short acute phase of stress (up to 30 days in order to cover such periods without having to change the business model) followed by a longer period of less acute but more prolonged stress (between 3 and 12 months).

PARAGRAPH_107320: 158. .In the design of scenarios, institutions should consider the impact of stress events for other risk types, e.g. credit risk losses and reputational risk events, on their liquidity position, and the possibility of an impact of fire sales from other institutions (e.g. spillovers) or from their own liquidity buffer on the market-to-market value of other assets they hold.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:43]
PARAGRAPH_107321: 159. The main methodology used for calculating the magnitude of the impact should be the net cash flow profile. For each scenario, at each stress level, the institution identifies cash inflows and outflows that are projected for each future time period and the resulting net cash flows. Institutions should consider the lowest cumulative point of net cash flows within the time period assessed in each given scenario.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:43]

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:44]
PARAGRAPH_107343: 170. Where less complex financial instruments are employed, institutions should calculate the effect of a shock using sensitivity analysis (without the identification of the origin of the shock, and by means of the simple application of the shock to the portfolio). Where an institution uses more complex financial instruments on which the shock has multiple and indirect effects, it should use more advanced approaches with specific definitions of the adverse (stress) situations reflecting relevant idiosyncratic risks.

PARAGRAPH_107349: 172. In assessing this risk in their stress testing programmes, institutions should take into account the credit risk of each exposure but also consider the additional sources of risks arising from the similar behaviour of certain exposures (i.e. higher correlation). These additional sources of risk under analysis should cover, but not be limited, to the following:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:45]

PARAGRAPH_107355: 173. In stress testing, especially institution-wide and including group stress testing, institutions should assess concentration risk considering on- and off-balance-sheet exposures, as well as banking, trading and hedging positions.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:45] [RISK:CONCENTRATION_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_107356: 74. Stress tests should take into account changes in the business environment that may occur and that would lead to the materialisation of concentration risk. In particular, stress tests should consider unusual but plausible changes in correlations between various types of risk factors as well as extreme and unusual changes in risk parameters, going beyond single risk factors, to look at scenarios that take account of interrelated risk factors and that feature not only first-round but also feedback effects.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:45]
PARAGRAPH_107357: 175. The way in which concentrated exposures perform in response to the same risk factors should be factored into the stress tests, including the risk of additional short-term losses as a result of concentrated exposures across the retail and corporate credit books or across different entities in a group.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:45]

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:46]
PARAGRAPH_107377: 182. Institutions should develop stress scenarios by changing different parameters to allow them to forecast foreign exchange credit portfolio performances in different cases, such as:

Furthermore, by means of stress testing, institutions should evaluate the reliability of their capital plans under stress conditions to ensure that they meet the capital requirements applicable to them. Any evaluation of capital plan reliability under stressed conditions should take into consideration scenario severity and occurrence probability. Institutions should also test the reliability of their liquidity plans to ensure that they can meet liabilities as they fall due under stress conditions. Institutions should assess the level of transferability of capital and liquidity resources in stressed conditions and consider any possible impediments, including legal, organisational and operational impediments.

PARAGRAPH_107418: 196. To assess possible responses to a stressed situation, institutions should identify the credible actions that are most relevant and when they would have to take them. Institutions should take into account that some management actions are required immediately and others are contingent on specific events happening, in which case clearly defined triggers for action should be identified beforehand. Management actions should be consistent with stated strategies and policies, for example in the context of stated dividend & policies. Institutions should be conservative about their ability to take mitigating management actions, recognising the possible impact of the stressed scenarios on other markets.

PARAGRAPH_107438: Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 provides the EBA with the responsibility to establish consistent, efficient and effective supervisory practices, within the European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS), to ensure the common, uniform and consistent application of Union law, and to issue guidelines and recommendations addressed to competent authorities or financial institutions.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:51] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_107439: More specifically, the EBA is mandated by Article 100(2) of Directive 2013/36/EU to foster sound and effective supervision across the EU arising from the requirements set out, while Article 107 of the same Directive stipulates that the EBA needs to assess the information provided by competent authorities for the purposes of developing consistency in the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP). These legal provisions empower the EBA to issue guidelines that ensure that competent authorities use common methodologies when conducting their annual supervisory stress testing tasks.

PARAGRAPH_107440: The following sections of the impact assessment focus on justifying the decision for the specific provisions in the updated version of the Guidelines on institutions' stress testing, and also on estimating the costs and benefits for institutions arising from the full implementation and ongoing application of the guidelines. It is noteworthy that the impact assessment quantifies the net impact from the full implementation of the guidelines, implying that the costs and benefits from the actual implementation of the guidelines arising from the exercise of a national discretion will be proportionate to the level of implementation in each Member State, i.e. Member States that do not fully implement the guidelines will incur less costs but will also benefit less from the advantages of the full implementation.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:51]
PARAGRAPH_107442: In 2010, the CEBS, the predecessor of the EBA, issued Guidelines on stress testing (GL32). Since then, there have been several de facto changes in conducting stress testing which relate to its coverage and usage and related methodologies. The recent financial crisis and the several negative events in the banking sector have highlighted significant lessons in relation to stress testing practices and have triggered changes in the conduct of stress testing. Aligning with international practices, EU supervisory bodies expect institutions to develop more advanced and up-to-date stress testing practices in light of this recent experience.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:51] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_107443: The EBA has also derived important conclusions from the 2013 EBA peer review on the implementation of the stress testing guidelines. The EBA performed the peer review to assess and compare the effectiveness of supervisory activities related to the review of credit institutions' own stress testing programmes across the EU, as well as the level of implementation of the guidelines

PARAGRAPH_107447: by competent authorities 9. Although the peer review concluded that all of the competent authorities' organisational and resource models have their own advantages, the involvement of dedicated technical experts in stress testing was not sufficient, irrespective of the model in question.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:52]
PARAGRAPH_107448: The peer review also demonstrated that competent authorities often focus on stress testing the largest institutions and devote far less attention to other institutions in their jurisdictions. Only a few competent authorities required reverse stress testing, and when they did, it was often only as part of recovery planning. In addition, there is vast diversity across jurisdictions on how competent authorities incorporate the outcome of stress testing into the SREP. Finally, in many instances, competent authorities observed that stress testing is still not sufficiently integrated into institutions' risk management frameworks or senior management decision-making processes. Where stress testing is used, the severity of scenarios is still not sufficient to address extreme adverse economic and financial conditions.

PARAGRAPH_107449: B. Policy objectives

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:52]
PARAGRAPH_107450: These guidelines aim to achieve convergence of the practices followed by institutions and competent authorities for stress testing across the EU. They provide detailed guidance with which the institutions should comply when designing and conducting a stress testing programme, addressing at the same time the deficiencies identified by the EBA as part of the peer review. They also provide guidance with a view to ensuring the convergence of institutions' stress testing in the context of the SREP performed by competent authorities.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:52]
PARAGRAPH_107451: To achieve this objective, the impact assessment should identify whether or not the relevant building blocks, required for an effective stress testing programme of the different approaches (spanning from a simple sensitivity analysis of single risk factors or portfolios to complex macroeconomic scenario stress testing on an institution-wide basis), provide a reasonable trade- off between the costs and benefits involved in their full implementation and ongoing application.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:53]
PARAGRAPH_107461: While drafting the stress testing guidelines, EBA staff and competent authorities considered several options that could be included in the final provisions.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:53]
PARAGRAPH_107462: Option 1: 'do nothing' (i.e. do not draft updated guidelines)

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:53]
PARAGRAPH_107463: This option implies that institutions carry out stress tests by relying on current practices without receiving any additional guidance in writing. Despite the fact that most of these practices have been agreed between the competent authorities and the EBA, the explicit scope of different approaches for the conduct of stress testing by institutions is missing. Furthermore, there are links between stress testing exercises and other forms of prudential supervision (SREP) that have not yet been completely established in order to ensure consistency and could improve prudential supervision. The use of these links and ensuring consistency should be thoroughly explained to institutions.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:53]
PARAGRAPH_107464: The 'do nothing' option would imply non-negligible operational costs for institutions, as there would be excessive communication between institutions, competent authorities and the EBA, and the risk of the inconsistent application of stress testing methodologies and subsequently the inconsistent application of the EBA Guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for SREP.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:53] [RISK:REPUTATIONAL_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_107465: Moreover, oral communication of updates on best practices to the competent authorities - although stress testing still seemingly relies on GL32, dating from 2010 - entails a level of reputational risk for institutions and supervisors alike.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:53]
PARAGRAPH_107466: Option 2: review GL32 and provide guidance to ensure the convergence of supervisory stress testing in the context of the SREP performed by competent authorities.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:53]
PARAGRAPH_107467: The main reasons for improving the existing guidelines are the following: (a) to address the follow- up from the 2013 peer review; (b) the SREP guidelines need supporting guidelines, specifically in relation to stress testing; and (c) the lessons learned from the 2014 EU-wide stress test should be put into practice. In particular, there is a need for a clear taxonomy on stress testing; and a need to understand the range of potential supervisory stress tests (to have an informed discussion about where is best to pitch the EBA stress tests vis à vis other supervisory stress tests).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:53] [RISK:OPERATIONAL_RISK] [RISK:CYBER_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_107468: Although in principle the guidelines remain largely valid, some areas require attention, namely data infrastructure; reverse stress testing; new individual risks (conduct-related risk and foreign exchange lending risk); operational risk (conduct-related risk and cyber risk); and the use of the outcome for capital adequacy assessment purposes (the general coverage of the SREP needs to be updated to reflect the new SREP guidelines). In addition, other areas can be also reviewed, namely individual risk areas as part of the body of the guidelines (i.e. no longer in the annexes; e.g. liquidity

PARAGRAPH_107473: E. Cost-benefit analysis

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:54]
PARAGRAPH_107474: The principle of proportionality applies to all aspects of stress testing, including methodology, frequency, discrimination between qualitative and quantitative assessment, and the level of details of the conduct of stress testing. The cost-benefit analysis has also followed the principle of proportionality, e.g. an institution that is currently required by the supervisor to conduct a less sophisticated approach, because of the nature of its products or its small size, will be allowed to follow the same approach in the future, while institutions that do not currently apply certain stress testing practices, as recommended by the guidelines, will be assumed to follow an approach that is more appropriate for their size, business model and the nature of their financial products.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:54]
PARAGRAPH_107475: The cost-benefit analysis assessed the net monetary impact of the operational changes proposed for implementation in relation to the current operational costs relating to the conduct of stress testing. The net impact on capital requirements, implied by the implementation of the current guidelines, cannot be precisely assessed; however, it is expected to be close to zero when quantifying it as a percentage of the total operational cost of a bank.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:54]
PARAGRAPH_107477: Benefits: the benefits for the institution are expected to be zero.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:54]
PARAGRAPH_107478: Costs: the institutions would face increasing costs, arising from unnecessary oral communication to seek clarifications on best practices for stress testing and their relation with other tools for prudential supervision (SREP guidelines). The magnitude of these costs would be low.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:54]
PARAGRAPH_107479: Net impact (benefits minus costs): negative (low).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:54]
PARAGRAPH_107481: Benefits: the transparency of the current stress testing practices would enhance the confidence of institutions and make the conduct of stress testing more effective and efficient. Although these benefits are not directly observable, not precisely measurable and will be spread over time, they are not negligible and cannot be ignored. The magnitude of the benefits would be low.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:54]
PARAGRAPH_107482: Costs: there is no cost for the institutions in relation to the review of the existing guidelines, as it only clarifies what practices the institutions should have been applying and in many cases what practices they already apply. There would be costs in the event of miscommunications or misunderstandings. The magnitude of the costs would be negligible and only related to initial requests for clarifications, which the institutions may request from the supervisors. This may take some time, which, when converted to monetary terms, implies some negligible cost.

PARAGRAPH_107488: The cost-benefit analysis in section E indicates that option 1 should be excluded as it produces a negative net impact. The cost-benefit analysis, enhanced by the qualitative assessment in section D, indicates that option 2 should be proposed for implementation, i.e. the review of GL32 to ensure the convergence of practices followed by institutions and competent authorities for stress testing across the EU, linking these practices with other tools for prudential supervision (SREP).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:55] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_107489: Following the principle of proportionality, these guidelines are applicable in their entirety to Category 1 institutions, as these are the systemically important institutions. Category 2 institutions, or non-systemic medium- to large-sized institutions, are required to follow those parts of the guidelines that are relevant to their institutions and to a level that reflects the complexity of their activities. These institutions can operate domestically or have sizable cross-border activities and may operate in different business lines, which needs to be reflected in the stress testing.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:55]
PARAGRAPH_107490: For Category 3 and 4 institutions, which include small and medium-sized institutions, the expectation is that they will follow the guidelines to the extent that is proportionate and relevant to their activities, resources and the risk posed to the financial system. The scope of stress testing for these institutions is therefore limited, reflecting the reduced scope of their activities and the limited risk to the system overall.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:55]
PARAGRAPH_107491: Nonetheless, the assessment of the cost-benefit analysis above assumes that institutions of Category 3 and 4 will also conduct stress testing exercises according to the proportional (for their size and nature) implementation of the guidelines. If these institutions do not conduct stress testing and/or do not follow the guidelines, the cost and net impact of option 3 will be reduced proportionally, although this reduction is expected to be marginal and not expected to affect the magnitude of the net impact because of the simplicity of the models that these institutions are assumed to apply.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:55]
PARAGRAPH_107492: Having taking into account the above assumptions, it is estimated that the total net benefit of implementing the guidelines, albeit low, could be allocated among the various categories of institutions as follows:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:57] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_107516: One respondent noted that it is important that supervisors do not underestimate the efforts that will have to be made by banks to implement and ensure compliance with these guidelines. In particular, some firms may need to undergo internal reorganisations in terms of their stress testing functions and/or create internal oversight functions. These changes will require a certain period of time and this must be reflected in the ultimate application date of the guidelines. Moreover, given that institutions should endeavour to comply with Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting , but that these principles will be in place after the stress testing guidelines, a grandfathering period to comply with the application of these guidelines would be welcome. Another respondent mentioned that the timeline of the implementation of the guidelines on stress testing and supervisory stress testing seems too ambitious. The respondent believes that the fourth quarter of 2016, the currently foreseen starting date of the guidelines' application as communicated by the EBA, is too early a start date for the application of the entire guidelines and would not leave enough time for banking entities to adjust to the new guidelines. In this context, it would be advisable to apply a phased approach differentiating which aspects of

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:57] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_107517: The guidelines were published in December 2015 for a three- month public consultation, which ended in 18 March 2016. They have been then finalised based on the outcomes of the consultation and will be translated into the official EU languages and published on the EBA website. The deadline for competent authorities to report whether or they comply with the guidelines will be two months after the publication of the translations. The EBA aims to finalise the proposed guidelines during 2018, taking into account the comments received during the second public consultation. As currently foreseen, the application date will be in 2019. The previous guidelines (GL32) published in 2010 remain largely valid. The EBA understands the challenges involved in the further development of stress testing programmes based on best practices and that this will go beyond the status quo for many institutions. The EBA recognises that institutions, after the application date, will continue to develop and enhance their systems and processes to meet supervisory expectations. The EBA does not see a need to split the requirements into several implementation phases. The flexibility of implementation should be maintained by taking into account proportionality principles and the corresponding assessments of competent authorities.

PARAGRAPH_107526: the guidelines would have to be implemented by the end of 2016 and which could implemented at a later stage. This is particularly important given the high number of stress test exercises and other regulatory requirements scheduled in 2016, such as the EBA stress test and the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP)-related stress test. Another respondent mentioned that a two-month implementation period is too short for such a comprehensive stress testing programme. Another respondent mentioned that the EBA draft guidelines on stress testing contain a number of suggestions that could contribute to the further development of banks' internal stress tests. At the same time, the guidelines are too detailed and too prescriptive in many cases and unduly reduce the amount of discretion and freedom essential in stress testing and thus cannot be applied flexibly enough. In some areas, the ideas appear to be guided too much by best practice and too little by the status quo of European banks. While supervisory proposals going beyond the status quo are, in principle, necessary and sensible for the further development of stress testing programmes in the medium term, they should not be prescribed as mandatory and relevant for SREP assessment from the fourth quarter of 2016. Further in-depth discussion with the industry on the direction that this further development should take would be advisable. Institutions should be given enough time to further develop their stress testing internally through adequate implementation periods, since the new requirements go beyond the CEBS Guidelines on stress testing (GL32). The respondent therefore suggests making a distinction, as far as possible, in all areas of the guidelines

PARAGRAPH_107534: between requirements that have to be complied with, at a minimum ('at least'), by the end of 2016 and further requirements. For these further requirements, staggered, gradual implementation over a period of several years should be specified. When setting the requirements that have to be complied with, at a minimum, from the end of 2016, it should be borne in mind that a large number of parallel stress testing requirements are currently set at national and international level (e.g. the EBA 2016 stress test, the SREP exercise, the internal capacity adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) and the internal liquidity adequacy assessment process (ILAAP)). Another respondent mentioned that banks might be required to undertake quite significant internal adjustments from both the organisational and the methodological development points of view (especially given the focus placed on some core aspects such as correlation, concentration and second-order effects, as well as the treatment of model risk). Therefore, the respondent would favour either a gradual phase-in of the guidelines or a later date of application than that currently envisaged.

PARAGRAPH_107536: One respondent mentioned that the current draft guidelines do not seem to consistently capture proportionality principles, since some abstracts in the guidelines would specifically mention proportionality considerations while others would not. To solve any uncertainty arising from this inconsistency, it would be helpful to explicitly emphasise the principle of proportionality under part 4 of the draft guidelines instead of having it only mentioned in part 1, the executive summary. The respondent would like to stress that proportionality considerations should apply not only to

PARAGRAPH_107547: small banks but also to large banks that have very low risk profiles, for instance as is the case for promotional banks involved in the financing of low risk areas including social housing, municipalities, SMEs and export credits. Two respondents proposed that the guidelines could have specific risk area materiality thresholds for institutions that are required to apply the guidelines to stress testing each individual risk area. The first respondent is concerned that developing a comprehensive stress testing framework for risk areas to which a firm has immaterial exposure would be overly burdensome and provide little or no risk management information. The other respondent is concerned that, by definition, this could mean that Category 2 institutions could end up doing much the same as Category 1 institutions. Another respondent mentioned that despite the fact that the principle of proportionality has been integrated into the draft guidelines on several occasions, the respondent sometimes gets the impression that the methods for these stress tests have a wide scope and the tasks are relatively prolonged and complicated, with the potential for large faults. Thus, small banks might have a hard time fulfilling these requirements. The principle of proportionality could be used to an even greater extent in the guidelines. Another respondent mentioned that, as guidelines under Pillar 2, the entire stress testing guidelines should be applied with the principle of proportionality in mind. This is not always made clear enough in the wording of the guidelines, however. For example, some sections (2, 3 and 4) contain a proportionality proviso, others do not. In contrast, the Background and rationale section (pp. 6-8) accompanying

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:60]
PARAGRAPH_107548: the idea is to concentrate this subject at the beginning of the guidelines, recognising that proportionality is applicable to all aspects of these guidelines, in a similar way to other EBA guidelines, instead of repeating the same concept many times throughout the guidelines. These guidelines recognise the principle of proportionality by describing both quantitative and qualitative aspects of stress testing: small and less complex institutions may focus more on the qualitative aspects while larger or more complex institutions will require more sophisticated stress testing techniques. Moreover, regarding scope and coverage, stress tests should capture risks at various levels in an institution. In this regard, according to the proportionality principle, the scope of stress testing may vary from simple portfolio level sensitivity or individual risk level analyses to comprehensive institution-wide scenario stress testing. Furthermore, the proportionality principle is invoked in these guidelines to discuss the level of sophistication of the stress testing methodologies, practices and infrastructure required in relation to the size, structure and internal organisation (also taking into account the nature, scope and complexity of activities) of an institution, always in connection with the SREP category to which that institution belongs.

The respondent therefore suggested incorporating this section into the wording of the actual guidelines (from p. 10). Paragraph 57, too, contains an important statement on proportionality, which would gain in value by being applied to the guidelines as a whole. Another respondent asked how proportionality of institutions is defined (asset size, market capitalisation, etc.) and what forms the basis of the proportionality principle.

PARAGRAPH_107558: One respondent mentions that institutions are subject to multiple annual requirements (supervisory stress tests; ICAAP; ILAAP; recovery and resolution plans; business model analysis; and other ad hoc stress test requirements (e.g. in relation to Brexit)). The lack of an integrated supervisory approach in relation to the set of requirements creates the risk of overlap and inefficiencies in information submissions. Institutions will gain in efficiency if recovery planning, supervisory stress testing, institution stress testing and ICAAP/ILAAP are all integrated and consolidated in one unique submission.

In view of the recent debates of the BCBS regarding operational risks and the ongoing BCBS work streams on the standardised approach for operational risk, all stress testing considerations regarding operational risks should be dealt with at a later stage once the BCBS proposals and EU legislation have been harmonised. By doing so, additional adjustments could be avoided and a level playing field would be guaranteed.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:62] [RISK:OPERATIONAL_RISK] [RISK:LEGAL_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_107574: Two respondents mentioned that the requirements on stress testing for operational risk and conduct-related risk are formulated separately, although conduct-related risk is included in the scope of operational risk as a part of legal risk. It is not clear why parts of the scope of operational risk should be considered separately for stress testing purposes and how such results should be integrated in the bank-wide stress testing scenarios. The separation of the scope for the quantitative assessment would also pose a particular challenge for banks using the advanced measurement approach (AMA) for operational risk because the relevant losses resulting from the legal risk or conduct-related risk events are considered within the AMA models often being developed and calibrated for the full scope of operational risk losses. Therefore, further clarification on regulators' expectations regarding the structure of stress tests for operational risk would be highly appreciated. As it stands now, many requirements formulated in the consultation paper (e.g. the requirements of items 132 and 140) represent general requirements on the operational risk management process or the risk inventory process. Such requirements should be included in the operational risk management guidelines or general guidelines on ICAAP and

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:62] [RISK:OPERATIONAL_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_107575: Conduct-related risk is part of operational risk. For the purposes of the calculation of capital requirement, institutions do not calculate individual capital requirements for different sub- categories. An institution can also follow this approach for stress testing. Nevertheless, if an institution follows a less sophisticated approach in Pillar 2, it might decide to or might be obligated to provide a more risk sensitive approach in Pillar 2 or in stress testing. In this case, an institution can decide to calculate either a combined impact or two individual impacts. The main purpose of section 4.7.5 is not to separate conduct- related risk from operational risk, as described in section 4.7.4, but to stress the importance of this sub-category. With regard to the perceived redundancy between several items and ICAAP requirements, the EBA believes that the requirements are not a repetition. In several aspects, they extend the perspective of stress testing beyond the persspective applied for Pillar 1 or for ICAAP. If certain aspects are repeated, this simply supports the overall presentation of expectations within the stress test.

Movement in the FX rate has an impact upon Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) and overall capital ratio. The respondent believes that it may be helpful to include this in the guidelines to alert institutions to these risks, taking into account any hedging and or management actions.

PARAGRAPH_107602: One respondent mentioned that in order to avoid deviating requirements from different guidelines, any potential overlap of frameworks should be ruled out. The respondent strongly recommends separating general requirements on risk management frameworks from specific stress testing guidelines. For example, stress testing guidelines for operational risk (paragraph 132), conduct-related risk (paragraph 140) and recovery planning (paragraph 99) include general requirements for operational risk management processes. Such requirements should be removed from the stress testing guidelines to ensure a consistent risk management framework.

PARAGRAPH_107603: The guidelines (paragraph 132) mention that, as operational losses may induce second-round effects (i.e. reputational risk), in order to account for such effects, the operational risk stress testing programme should be thoroughly integrated into the institution-wide stress test and should include interconnections with liquidity and own funds requirements. In addition, the guidelines (paragraph 140) mention that, in their stress testing, institutions should assess the relevance and significance of exposures to conduct-related risk and associated litigation costs (providing several examples to take into account in stress tests). Moreover, the guidelines (paragraph 99) mention that reverse stress testing should contribute to the recovery plan scenarios by using a dynamic and quantitative scenario narrative (providing examples of types of narratives that are necessary). Therefore, the paragraphs are not general requirements but specific to stress testing, despite some possible overlaps with risk management requirements.

Another respondent mentioned that it is surprised that the taxonomy lacks a definition of the key term 'stress test'. Such a definition should be included because various national supervisors have drafted their own definitions of a 'stress test'. This definition should also make clear where stress scenarios stand in relation to the implicitly or explicitly used scenarios in 'regular' risk measurement. This question basically concerns all types of risk, but can be illustrated particularly well by taking operational risk as an example: institutions that use the AMA must use scenario analyses as an element in the calculation of their own funds requirements.

PARAGRAPH_107620: One respondent mentioned that, in terms of stress testing techniques, institutions have a repertoire of stress testing approaches. A 'bottom-up' approach requires a high degree of data granularity and model segmentation, but simple 'top-down' approaches are also used, e.g. to respond to senior management requests for the rapid analysis of a fast- emerging event. Institutions will at times employ a combination of approaches, taking into account materiality and proportionality. It would be beneficial for the guidelines to acknowledge that this is good practice. The respondent would prefer the generally accepted segmentation to be defined as 'Institutional stress test' and 'Supervisory stress test' to differentiate the scope.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:65]
PARAGRAPH_107621: These guidelines provide a clear taxonomy precisely because there remains substantial ambiguity and overlap in several terms and definitions. The guidelines' definition of 'Bottom-up stress test' sets out that this type of stress test is carried out by the institution. A 'Top- down stress test' is carried out by the competent authority or the macroprudential authority. These definitions have always been used at the EU level, for instance in the context of EU-wide stress test exercises. The same definitions apply to many competent authorities around the world, so current practices were taken into account. Institutions should use the guidelines' definitions in communications with the competent authorities or the macroprudential authorities in order to provide a harmonised language that is not ambiguous instead of internal definitions developed by institutions.

PARAGRAPH_107638: One respondent mentioned that it does not agree that, as stated under Definitions/taxonomy, point (10), sub-point iii, it is the responsibility of 'the institution to decide on the kind and timing (triggering events) of management or other actions necessary both for rectifying business failures or of other problems and for aligning its risk appetite with the actual risks revealed by the reverse stress testing'. The respondent considers that management have a duty to consider the risk appetite but not necessarily align it to the results of the stress test. The respondent considers that the actions to be taken in resolution (failure) are the competent authorities' responsibility. The same respondent also mentioned that, rather than state in point (10), sub-point iv, that 'specific reverse stress testing can be also applied in the context of recovery planning', it would make more sense to explain that reverse stress testing should be seen as an analytical technique and that it is therefore separate from recovery stress testing and resolution planning, but can be used to inform a recovery

PARAGRAPH_107639: The guidelines mention that a reverse stress test is an institution stress test that starts from the identification of the pre-defined outcome (e.g. the point at which an institution business model becomes unviable, or at which the institution can be considered as failing or likely to fail within the meaning of Article 32 of Directive 2014/59/EU) and then explores scenarios and circumstances that might cause this to occur. Reverse stress testing has all of the following characteristics: i. it is used as a risk management tool aimed at increasing the institution's awareness of its vulnerabilities by means of the institution explicitly identifying and assessing the scenarios (or combination of scenarios) that result in a pre-defined outcome; ii. the institution estimates the likelihood of these scenarios occurring; iii. the institution decides on the kind and timing (triggering events) of management or other actions necessary both for rectifying business failures or of other problems and for aligning

The EBA considers that it is the responsibility of the institution to decide (not necessarily a duty) on how to align its risk appetite with the actual risks revealed by the reverse stress testing. The sentence has been clarified by separating the items. The EBA considers that the definition presents a separation between reverse stress testing used in a wider context (e.g. risk assessment tool) and reverse stress testing used in specific contexts (e.g. recovery planning). The EBA considers that the definition could be clarified by mentioning that reverse stress tests applied in a wider context can be used to inform a recovery plan stress test by identifying the conditions under which the recovery might need to be planned. In addition, the items regarding characteristics can be one or more and the sentence has been changed accordingly.

PARAGRAPH_107652: One respondent would appreciate clarification related to the guidance on the exact nature of feedback effects. The respondent currently considers macroeconomic feedback effects in scenario design and would welcome confirmation of the EBA's intent in this area. The respondent would also like to highlight that the assessment of 'spillover effects caused by the responses of individual institutions to an external shock' does not seem feasible for an isolated institution. The respondent would expect such effects to be covered as part of the supervisory stress test.

PARAGRAPH_107653: The guidelines mention that second-round or feedback effects refer to the spillover effects caused by the responses of individual institutions to an external original shock, which - in aggregate - generally amplify (or may also mitigate) such an original shock, thereby causing an additional negative feedback loop. The nature of feedback effects is not limited to macroeconomic effects.

The guidelines mention that institutions should make qualitative assessments of second-round or feedback effects of stress where appropriate and should take into account the impact of second-round effects in the individual risk for stress testing. The EBA considers that the corresponding paragraphs for institutions could be clarified by mentioning that the assessment is at individual level, i.e. not at aggregate level, and by providing an example. The EBA does not provide information on how the second-round effects should be treated by individual institutions (mentioning the use of qualitative assessments where appropriate, therefore reducing possible model risk) to avoid being too prescriptive.

The respondent believes that if supervisory expectations are for a sort of single 'Stress Test Book', where policies, procedures and methodologies supporting all stress test types at all levels are covered, a concept similar to that of the Readers' Manual recently introduced in the EBA draft guidelines on ICAAP/ILAAP information collected for SREP purposes might prove beneficial.

If stress tests carried out at the first level of analysis are an integral part of risk management and are detailed in the corresponding risk management frameworks, the documentation regarding the stress testing programme can make clear references to such information from other sources.

The same respondent asked if the programme should cover and document all types of stress tests carried out at the single risk type and/or portfolio level as well as firm-wide exercises or should it just focus on the latter. Stress tests carried out at the first level of analysis are generally an integral part of risk management so that measurement of the various individual risk types and their related policies, procedures and methodologies are therefore detailed in the corresponding risk management frameworks. Would encompassing them within the stress test programme not represent just a duplication? At the other end of the spectrum, firm-wide stress tests largely overlap with the stress tests carried out as part of ICAAP/ILAAP and in the recovery plan process and as such they also represent a risk of consistency and duplication.

These areas are considered independent from those that are responsible for the development of the stress testing programme.

In addition, that those areas that must be involved in the assessment process should be those that show significant expertise should be specified.

This requirement should be amended. Another respondent noted that paragraph 22 mentions the key role of non-involved external experts in the yearly assessment of the stress testing programme and paragraph 61 makes reference to the expert review of models' assumptions.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:72]
PARAGRAPH_107734: One respondent mentioned that while the management body will stipulate scenarios and have key results reported to it, its full involvement in the design and implementation of a stress testing programme is not practicable for large and complex institutions. The involvement of the management body should be inversely proportionate to the size of an institution: the larger the institution, the more the stress testing programme will be delegated to senior management and committees. The definition of 'management body'

The term 'management body' is already defined in other regulatory products. The guidelines do not mention the need for full involvement regarding implementation. The guidelines mention, among other issues, that the management body of the institutions should ensure that clear responsibilities and resources are assigned for the execution of the programme.

PARAGRAPH_107747: Two respondents mentioned that according to paragraph 26, management actions should be discussed with the relevant supervisor. However, it should be clarified that, in this regard, the management body must be in the position to only explain such 'actions', and that these do not need to be approved ex ante by the supervisor. One respondent asked why external consultants responsible for stress testing are mentioned. It considers that this is irrelevant with regard to the subject of these guidelines.

PARAGRAPH_107748: The guidelines mention that institutions should ensure that their management body holds an understanding of the material aspects of the stress testing programme that enables it to: (a) actively engage in discussions with stress testing committees of the institutions, where applicable, or with senior management or external consultants responsible for stress testing; (b) challenge key modelling assumptions, the scenario selection and the assumptions underlying the stress tests in general; and (c) decide on the necessary management actions and discuss them with the competent authorities. The guidelines mention that the management body of an institution should hold an understanding of the material aspects of the stress testing programme that enables it to decide on the necessary management actions and discuss them with the competent authorities, without mentioning possible ex ante approval.

However, the scope of application of these BCBS principles is restricted to systemically important banks (SIBs).

According to the respondent, this is not possible for either risk measurement under normal market conditions or risk measurement under stress conditions, because each quantitative risk assessment is individual and subjective to a certain extent.

PARAGRAPH_107787: One respondent noted that correlations that tend to increase during times of economic or financial distress might happen and might not happen. The respondent thinks it would be better to phrase the guidance as 'during times of economic or financial distress institutions should take into account that correlations may be different to those currently or historically observed'. Two respondents disagreed that correlations tend to increase during times of stress and need to be analysed on a case-by-case basis.

PARAGRAPH_107788: The guidelines mention that stress tests should also take into account that correlations tend (i.e. not always but in general) to increase during times of economic or financial distress. The EBA agrees that correlations may be different from those currently or historically observed; however, it prefers to emphasise that correlations tend to increase during times of economic or financial distress rather than mentioning that correlations may be different.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:76]
PARAGRAPH_107801: One respondent mentioned the need to limit stress testing to 'material' risks. One respondent mentioned that the paragraph seems to suggest that the individual portfolio level corresponds to the business unit level. The guidelines do not specify the regulatory expectations with respect to individual portfolio level stress testing. The respondent would therefore welcome further clarification of this definition, as well as the specific regulatory expectations in this area.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:76]
PARAGRAPH_107802: The guidelines mention that institutions should perform stress tests on an individual portfolio level basis, covering all risk types that affect these portfolios, using both sensitivity and scenario analyses. The EBA considers that institutions should not limit stress testing to material risks, as this may risk excluding one of the possible purposes of the stress tests, i.e. the identification of potentially underestimated (and non-material) risks. Institutions should also identify risk factors and their adequate level of stress, wherever possible, at the level of an individual portfolio. The guidelines also provide a definition in the taxonomy mentioning that a portfolio level stress test is a stress test of individual or several portfolios with the focus on the implications of the shocks from a single risk factor or multiple risk factors. Stress tests should capture risks at various levels in an institution. In this regard, according to the proportionality principle, the scope of stress testing may vary from simple portfolio level sensitivity or individual risk level analyses to comprehensive institution-wide scenario stress testing. See the section on portfolio and individual risk level stress testing for more details.

The EBA considers that the requirement is not confined to entities whose risks are material in a group context. The group stress testing programme should include and address, to the extent appropriate, all institutions subject to consolidation (paragraph 14). The EBA considers that item (b) needs to continue to be part of the current paragraph.

PARAGRAPH_107831: One respondent mentioned that the general treatment of the stress test types, out of the context of the specific individual risks, does not signal clearly what the supervisory expectations are with respect to the use of the various stress test techniques. The respondent has the following question: 'specifically, is it expected that both sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis are used at all stress testing levels and for all risk types?' The respondent mentioned that if this were the case, it would seem an inappropriate requirement, as certain types of analyses are better suited to certain types of risks (e.g. sensitivity analysis is a common practice for market risk and IRR, but not for other risks such as credit risk).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:78] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_107832: The guidelines mention that the specific design, complexity and level of detail of the stress test methodologies should be appropriate to the institution's size and complexity and should take into account the strategy and business model, as well as models and portfolio characteristics of the institution. The guidelines also mention that institutions should conduct sensitivity analyses at the level of individual exposures, portfolios or business units, institution wide, and for specific risk types as proportionate to their complexity. The EBA considers that institutions should assess at which aggregation level sensitivity analyses are meaningful or even feasible. So, it is not expected that both sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis are used at all stress testing levels and for all risk types, unless meaningful, feasible and appropriate for the institution's complexity and the type of risks.

PARAGRAPH_107857: One respondent mentioned that it supports the requirement to use sensitivity analysis at the risk type and the portfolio level; however, it considers that it will be a challenge to perform a sensitivity analysis at group level taking into account that such an analysis requires the use of various models and risk engines across all risk types. The respondent would therefore appreciate it if institutions were permitted to decide at which aggregation level sensitivity analyses would be meaningful or even feasible. Another respondent mentioned that sensitivity analyses have to be performed at the level of individual exposures and portfolios, and institution wide (paragraph 64). In addition, different degrees of severity should be calculated. The required sensitivity analyses would thus be multiplied if different degrees of severity have to be analysed at several levels. In addition, there are multi-risk factor analyses,

PARAGRAPH_107858: The guidelines mention that institutions should conduct sensitivity analyses at the level of individual exposures, portfolios or business units and institution wide, and for specific risk types as proportionate to their complexity.

PARAGRAPH_107870: One respondent mentioned that the guidelines imply that there are thresholds - cliff effects - beyond which correlations and risks change in a stepped way or the slope of the changes may be broken. The respondent mentioned that it is possible that changes in correlation and risk profiles could occur for other reasons without changes in the severity of a scenario.

PARAGRAPH_107871: The guidelines mention that the institutions should define the risk factors identified using different degrees of severity as an important step in their analysis to reveal nonlinearities and threshold effects, i.e. critical values of risk factors beyond which stress responses accelerate. The EBA considers that, in the context of sensitivity analysis, the usage of different degrees of severity, which is not restricted to the scenario, is essential in order to take into account the effect of nonlinearities. Other sources of nonlinearities are expected to be considered when carrying out the analysis at different degrees of severity.

In fact it is likely that the BCBS will soon issue guidance on portfolios that it does not think can be modelled. The respondent acknowledged the recognition of the use of expert judgement (paragraph 93), but recommends that the EBA review its guidance with regard to the dependency on statistical probability distributions to assess the plausibility of scenarios.

Relevant data may be internal and/or external and incorporate benchmarking and supervisory guidance'. The respondent mentioned that the guidelines presume that each institution can identify another institution with similar risks and similar business models and that this would require an in-depth knowledge of competitors and their plans.

Two respondents mentioned that according to paragraph 73, the scenarios should at least have characteristics as listed under (a) to (f). The characteristic listed under (e) in particular is far too ambitious (innovation, technological developments, sophisticated financial products), and should therefore not come into force by the end of 2016.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:82] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_107909: The guidelines mention that institutions should ensure that their stress test scenarios meet at least the following requirements among others: (c) include a coherent narrative for the scenario, covering all relevant risk factors as well as their (forward-looking) development on the basis of multiple trigger events (i.e. monetary policy, financial sector developments, commodity prices, political events and natural disasters); institutions should ensure that the narrative scenario is plausible and non-paradoxical when assuming the co-movement of risk factors and the corresponding reaction of market participants; and, where certain risk factors are excluded from the narrative scenario, institutions should ensure that this exclusion is fully justified and documented; ( ... ). The EBA considers that the paragraph could be clarified by using the synonymous word 'non-contradictory' for 'non-paradoxical'. Regarding item (e), the guidelines mention that institutions should ensure that their stress test scenarios take into account innovation and more specifically technological developments or sophisticated financial products without disregarding their interaction with more traditional products.

The EBA recognises that institutions after the application date will continue to develop and enhance their systems and processes to meet supervisory expectations. The EBA does not see a need to split the requirements into several implementation phases. The flexibility of implementation should be maintained by taking into account proportionality principles and the corresponding assessment of competent authorities.

The EBA considers that the term 'relevant risk factors' could be changed to 'main risk factors'. The EBA considers that the identification of material risk factors is a natural consequence of the mentioned requirements. In addition, institutions could provide more details if they consider such information (e.g. identification under the internal risk cartography) necessary.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:84]
PARAGRAPH_107933: One respondent mentioned that it considers that inclusion of the qualification 'exceptional' to be unnecessary. Another respondent noted that the guidelines cover several types of stress testing with different degrees of severity (e.g. ICAAP/ILAAP stress tests; reverse stress testing; supervisory stress tests). Concepts of severity and plausibility of scenarios are included but not quantified objectively. Two respondents mentioned that the degree of severity of the stress test is defined in paragraph 9(12): Severity of scenario. However, there is no uniform system with which to determine the degree of severity. Because of the qualitative nature of the stress test, it is questionable as to whether a uniform assessment scheme can exist. The degree of severity of the stress test is therefore only measurable and comparable to a limited extent. In order to prevent the risk of the unfair treatment of institutions arising, more accurate information on the degree of severity would be useful. One respondent mentioned that, in paragraph 77(a), it is expected that the analysis of the stability of the financial system will be included in the scenario analysis. However, the respondent considers this rather to be a duty of the supervisor, and not of the bank. In addition, the respondent considers that it would be difficult to meet the requirements, because of insufficient or missing data. According to the respondent, this passage should therefore be removed.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:84] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_107934: The guidelines mention that institutions should ensure that stress testing is based on exceptional but plausible events with an adequate degree of severity. For that purpose, stress tests should be: (a) meaningful in terms of providing the appropriate type of information with a view to promoting the stability of the institution and, when relevant, the financial system at all points in the economic cycle and over market fluctuations including funding markets; and (b) consistently applied across the institution, recognising that identical scenarios are not necessarily severe for all business lines. The EBA considers that the inclusion of the qualification 'exceptional' is necessary to express the type of events of a scenario and the corresponding severity; however, it could be changed to the word 'severe'. The EBA considers that the taxonomy provides definitions for both severity and plausibility (and also anchor scenarios). Several requirements are provided to assess the level of severity. The degree of deterioration of the scenario (from baseline to adverse scenario) should be expressed in terms of the underlying macroeconomic and financial variables (or any other assumptions). The greater the severity of the scenario, in general, the larger the impact of the stress test on the institution, thereby determining the actual severity of the stress test. Given the different purposes and types of stress testing, the level of severity is not quantified objectively but presented throughout by the use and assessment of several requirements (e.g. the reference to possible anchor scenarios usually designed by a competent authority to set the severity standard for a particular stress test; the use of a range of scenarios encompassing different

The guidelines mention that scenarios identified through reverse stress tests are used as complementary/additional information for comparison purposes and that reverse stress testing is a useful way of assessing the severity of scenarios. The EBA considers that the guidelines need to allow a sufficient degree of discretion when comparing the stress tests for ICAAP/ILAAP purposes and recovery planning, for instance regarding the metrics to consider and the level of the applied shock considered acceptable. The EBA considers that the paragraph could be clarified to mention useful methods of assessment, considering the specific implications of the reverse stress test design on the scenario plausibility.

PARAGRAPH_107986: One respondent is somewhat cautious about its wider deployment in practice, as the potentially infinite number of degrees of freedom that are available when constructing a scenario that would lead to the point of the non-viability of a firm creates a significant degree of complexity to manage. This applies in particular to pan-EU and international banks that have a high degree of diversification across countries, customer types and product types. The development of multiple scenarios and the non-linear causal relationships that can occur in a reverse stress testing environment can

PARAGRAPH_107987: The EBA provides several incentives for the use of reverse stress testing in a wider context, i.e. not only for recovery and resolution planning. An institution should consider reverse stress testing not only as part of its stress testing programme but also as a regular risk management tool, carried out regularly by all types of institutions and at the same level of application as ICAAP and ILAAP (e.g. institution-wide and covering all relevant risk types), sharing the same governance and quality standards and to complement other types of stress testing.

PARAGRAPH_107997: become difficult to manage and, importantly, the outcomes may be difficult to interpret. Another respondent recommends developing reverse stress testing in the context of recovery planning rather than considering it as a regular risk management tool. Another respondent mentioned that reverse stress testing can be part of a bank's regular stress testing process; however, it is solely used to inform management about a firm's key vulnerabilities. The respondent mentioned that reverse stress testing should not be used to inform contingency planning and should not affect business and capital decisions, since these processes are based on very different assumptions and perimeters. Specifically, for institutions with adequate capitalisation, reverse stress tests may result in rather implausible scenarios which are of limited use for bank steering. The intentions of the guidelines 'to ... increase the institution's awareness of its vulnerabilities' and to 'understand the viability and sustainability of their business models and strategies' are equally achieved by the more plausible near-default scenarios as part of the recovery planning process. The respondent would therefore appreciate more flexibility in this regard and for the use of reverse stress scenarios not to be overemphasised. Another respondent mentioned that the role of reverse stress testing seems overrated despite the fact that this practice has shown limitations in the context of recovery planning. For banking entities disposing of a high level of capitalisation, stress testing built up on 'near-default scenarios' could lead to distorted results and would imply a lower credibility of the actual stress testing exercise. The

PARAGRAPH_107998: The EBA considers that the guidelines allow a sufficient degree of discretion when performing stress testing. The degree of freedom that is available when constructing a scenario for reverse stress testing should be seen as an advantage of this type of stress test. Institutions should include scenarios identified through the reverse stress tests to complement the range of stress test scenarios they undertake and for comparison purposes in order to assess overall severity, allowing the identification of severe but still plausible scenarios. As part of regular risk management, it is important that institutions identify measures that provide alerts when a scenario turns into reality. Therefore, the existence of multiple scenarios and their non-linear causal relationships, despite possible difficulties in interpretation, should be identified by institutions and taken into account as complementary information.

PARAGRAPH_108006: respondent considers that it would be important to leave enough flexibility for banking institutions in the design, planning and implementation of the stress testing. Another respondent mentioned that the role of stress tests is strengthened significantly in the present consultation paper, although stress tests displayed evident weaknesses in recovery planning. In the case of well- to very-well- capitalised institutions, reverse stress tests or near-default scenarios produced scenarios of little relevance in management terms. There is, moreover, the danger of non- acceptance of stress testing results. The targets communicated in the consultation paper (such as identifying current and potential vulnerabilities, identifying business model and business strategy risk or assessing the sustainability of business models) can be achieved just as well through the use of 'severe but still plausible scenarios'. The respondent believes that institutions should be allowed some degree of discretion when performing stress testing. Another respondent welcomed, in principle, linking reverse stress testing and recovery planning scenarios. Reverse stress testing is always performed at individual institution level under these guidelines. In the case of recovery planning, institutions that belong to an institutional protection scheme are given the option of conducting recovery planning at individual institution level or at institutional protection scheme level. It should therefore be ensured that this option for institutions belonging to an institutional protection scheme is not impaired by linking recovery planning and reverse stress testing.

PARAGRAPH_108021: understand the viability and sustainability of their business models and strategies, as well as to identify situations in which they might be considered failing or likely to fail within the meaning of Article 32 of Directive 2014/59/EU. It is important that institutions identify measures that provide alerts when a scenario turns into reality. To that end, institutions should: (a) identify the pre-defined outcome to be tested (e.g. of a business model becoming unviable); (b) identify possible adverse circumstances that would expose them to severe vulnerabilities and cause the pre-defined outcome; (c) assess (depending on the institution's size, as well as the nature, scale, complexity and riskiness of its business activities) the likelihood that events included in the scenarios leading to the pre-defined outcome; and (d) adopt effective arrangements, processes, systems or other measures to prevent or mitigate identified risks and vulnerabilities. The paragraph is general and applies not only to recovery planning. The EBA considers that the paragraph already includes possible recovery indicators, among other indicators.

Another respondent mentioned that paragraph 90 correctly states that reverse stress tests should be seen as complementing the internal models used to calculate capital requirements. It also states that they are designed to reveal inadequacies of these internal models. The respondent does not understand this. These models are not normally developed on the assumption of a stress situation, i.e. under fundamentally different environmental conditions. Validation of these internal models on a stress test basis is not possible. The requirement should be deleted.

It would thus be reasonable to refrain from the requirement for a quantitative calculation.

PARAGRAPH_108081: One respondent mentioned that, because of the required severity for reverse stress testing, this approach leads by definition to scenarios with low probability of occurrence, which may be less credible and less appropriate for testing the recovery plan. Recovery planning should thus primarily rely on the most relevant 'near-default' scenarios, as they ensure a proper balance between severity, consistency with the institution's strategy and business model, and, finally, more credibility. In addition, it is not clear why reverse stress testing should be required to fulfil the expectations regarding a recovery plan as outlined in paragraph 99. This could be fully achieved within the regular recovery planning framework. Two respondents mentioned that the overall classification, i.e. the relationship between ICAAP stress test (or regular scenarios) versus inverse scenarios versus recovery planning scenarios and their interaction during calibration, seems unclear.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:94] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_108082: The guidelines mention that institutions should use reverse stress testing to assist with the development, assessment and calibration of the 'near-default' scenarios used for recovery planning. Institutions should use reverse stress testing to identify the risk factors and further understand and describe the scenarios that would result in 'near default', assessing effective recovery actions that can be credibly implemented, either in advance or as the risk factors or scenarios develop. Reverse stress testing should contribute to the recovery plan scenarios by using a dynamic and quantitative scenario narrative: (a) the recovery triggers (i.e. at which point the institution would enact recovery actions in the hypothetical scenario); (b) the recovery actions required and their expected effectiveness, including the method of assessing that effectiveness (i.e. indicators that should be monitored to conclude that no further action is required); (c) the appropriate timing and process required for those recovery actions; and (d) in the case of further stress, points (b) and (c) for the potential additional recovery actions required to address residual risks. Given that the aim of a recovery plan is to prove the capacity to restore the viability of an institution, these scenarios should be designed as 'near-default' situations, i.e. they should bring an institution close to failure but no further. This element should be taken into consideration when considering, for example, using reverse stress testing to identify the most appropriate scenarios. See the EBA Guidelines on the range of scenarios to be used in recovery plans for additional details (e.g. the BRRD).

For instance, as part of regular risk management, it is important that institutions identify measures that provide alerts in the context of recovery planning and recovery indicators, when a scenario turns into reality.

PARAGRAPH_108094: Two respondents mentioned that, according to paragraph 96, stress tests for ICAAP and ILAAP purposes, as well as recovery planning, should not be combined, but should however be comparable. In terms of content, in paragraph 96 there appears to be a contradiction in the requirement that stress scenarios and ICAAP/ILAAP stress tests should not be interlinked, since this is asked for in other parts of the draft guidelines (i.e. paragraph 224). The respondent mentioned that the ban on interlinking should be removed. Another respondent mentioned that given that paragraph 96 implies the necessity of two sets of reverse stress test respectively for ICAAP/ILAAP purposes and for recovery planning, more detailed explanations as to how reverse stress tests should be engineered for ICAAP purposes would be welcome: what are the pre-defined outcomes that should be targeted/tested?

PARAGRAPH_108095: The guidelines mention that, because of the different objectives of the two sets of reverse stress tests, the stress tests for ICAAP and ILAAP purposes and recovery planning should not be interlinked but compared with one another. The guidelines also mention, regarding supervisory stress testing, that competent authorities should also use the scenarios and outcomes of supervisory stress tests as additional sources of information in the assessment of institutions' recovery plans, in particular when assessing the choice and severity of scenarios and assumptions used by the institution. In this assessment, the supervisory stress tests scenarios should, where appropriate and in particular where they satisfy the conditions set out in the EBA Guidelines on the range of scenarios to be used in recovery plans, be used as a reference point for the assessment of the institution's own scenarios and assumptions. If a competent authority identifies deficiencies in the scenarios or assumptions by the institution for the purposes of recovery planning, it should, where appropriate, in addition to requiring the institution to modify their own scenarios, demand that the institution use the supervisory stress testing scenarios and assumptions. When assessing the appropriateness of such a demand, competent authorities should take all relevant factors into account, paying particular attention

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:96]
PARAGRAPH_108108: Two respondents mentioned that the paragraph requires 'additional recovery actions to address residual risks'. Stress scenarios for recovery planning follow the 'near-default' criterion, i.e. they are severe enough that the institution can restore capital and liquidity only by carrying out all realisable, private recovery measures available. Hence, by definition, there will be no further recovery measures available. The respondent therefore suggests withdrawing paragraph 99(d).

PARAGRAPH_108109: The EBA considers that reverse stress testing should contribute to the recovery plan scenarios by using a dynamic and quantitative scenario narrative, taking into account the following: (a) the recovery triggers (i.e. at which point the institution would enact recovery actions in the hypothetical scenario); (b) the recovery actions required and their expected effectiveness, including the method of assessing that effectiveness (i.e. indicators that should be monitored to conclude that no further action is required); (c) the appropriate timing and process required for those recovery actions; and (d) in the case of further stress, points (b) and (c) for the potential additional recovery actions required to address residual risks. In a dynamic setting, the EBA considers that residual risks may exist and may not be totally covered, so further recovery measures may be available during the process.

PARAGRAPH_108123: when data are available they may well not cover more than 10 years of history. The respondent is therefore of the opinion that the guidelines should provide more room for expert-based parameter setting. This could, for example, be done by defining guidelines for setting these expert-based parameters.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:97] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK] [RISK:OPERATIONAL_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_108124: such as probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD), expected loss (EL) and risk exposure amount and the impact on credit losses and own funds requirements should be taken into account wherever possible. Moreover, for the estimation of future losses, institutions should, where appropriate, rely on credit risk parameters different from the parameters applied in the calculation of capital requirements, which are usually through-the-cycle (TTC) for PD and under downturn conditions for LGD. In particular, institutions should, where relevant, apply estimates based on point-in-time parameters in accordance with the severity of the scenario for the purpose of estimating credit losses. Therefore, that lengthy time series will always be available is not assumed as part of the guidelines and quantitative analysis and empirical evidence are considered only where possible and historical relationships and data should be challenged as well (and based on the principle of proportionality), as mentioned in several paragraphs. For instance, regarding operational risk, the use of expert judgement to overcome a possible lack of historical information is mentioned (paragraph 137). When an institution expands its business in the local or in the international market through mergers and acquisitions, the design of new products or the development of new business line, the severe but plausible stress test scenarios should be based on expert judgement to overcome the possible lack of historical information. For instance, for credit risk, institutions should apply, to the extent appropriate, credit risk internal model approaches that challenge historical relationships and data, and simulations of credit quality migrations among categories of exposures to provide an estimate of losses (paragraph 115).

PARAGRAPH_108138: One respondent mentioned that credit risk stress testing should encompass everything from simple sensitivity analyses to stress scenarios (paragraph 105). It should be performed both at different levels - market wide, counterparty specific and sector specific - or at a combination of these levels and with different time horizons (paragraph 107). In the process, the numerous sensitivity analyses required under paragraph 64 ff. of the draft guidelines must be considered.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:98] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_108139: The guidelines mention that institutions should ensure that credit risk is assessed at various levels of shock scenarios from simple sensitivity analyses to institution-wide stress tests, or to group- wide stress tests, in particular: (a) market-wide shock scenarios (e.g. a sharp slowdown of the economy that affects portfolio quality for all of the creditors); (b) counterparty-specific and idiosyncratic shock scenarios (e.g. bankruptcy of the largest bank creditor); (c) sector specific and region specific shock scenarios; and (d) a combination of the above. Institutions should subject risk factors to sensitivity analyses, which in turn should provide quantitative background information for the design of scenarios. Institutions should apply different time horizons when applying their stress scenarios. The time horizon should range from overnight (one-off effect) up to longer terms (e.g. a creeping economic downturn). The EBA considers that sensitivity analysis is taken into account and expressed.

PARAGRAPH_108210: The guidelines also mention that institutions should conduct stress tests for their positions in financial instruments in the trading and AFS portfolios (i.e. accounting terms to classify financial assets), including securitisation instruments/positions and covered bonds.

PARAGRAPH_108213: The guidelines mention that institutions should apply a range of severe but plausible scenarios for all positions referred to in the previous paragraph, e.g. exceptional changes in market prices, shortages of liquidity in the markets or defaults of large market participants. Dependencies and correlations between different markets and, consequently, adverse changes in correlations should, where appropriate, also be taken into account and factored in. The impact on accounting CVA and on reserves related to institutions' portfolios (e.g. reserves for liquidity, for modelling uncertainties) should be taken into account equally in their stress tests. The EBA considers that the paragraph could be clarified by adding that market risk reserve stress testing should be substantiated.

PARAGRAPH_108216: Two respondents mentioned that paragraph 128 demands that 'fat tail risk issues' in particular should be taken into account, as part of the stress test. While this is reasonable in general, it should be added that institutions are obliged to do this only if non-stressed value at risk (VaR) and IRC (if determined) are in a position to take fat tails into account in an appropriate manner.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:102]
PARAGRAPH_108217: The guidelines mention that institutions should take into account that the main weaknesses of the VaR models relate to the non- capturing or the underestimation of tail risk by historical data (fat tails). To capture fat tails, institutions should apply severe hypothetical scenarios. Where risk is assessed against possible time horizons and percentile confidence levels, institutions should consider tail events beyond those confidence levels.

PARAGRAPH_108228: One respondent mentioned that, in some institutions, operational risk stress testing (ORST) methodology leverages operational risk capital scenarios' internal models, which are used for ICAAP/Pillar 2 capital. The effect of possible changes on the Standardised Measurement Approach (Basel Committee consultation in 2016) - if implemented - is that internal models of operational risk will no longer be permitted for Pillar 1 calculations of the minimum capital requirement. The consequence may be a more prescriptive and less risk sensitive approach to the stress testing of operational risk. The respondent welcomed receiving EBA confirmation that the 'risk sensitiveness' of an institution's stress testing from an operational risk perspective may remain unchanged. Another respondent recommended extending the consultation period to ensure proper consideration of the latest developments in the area of operational risk.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:103] [RISK:LIQUIDITY_RISK] [RISK:OPERATIONAL_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_108229: The guidelines define a sensitivity analysis as a stress test that measures the potential impact of a specific single risk factor or simple multi-risk factors, affecting capital or liquidity, on a particular portfolio or on the institution as a whole. Operational risk is included and estimations should include risk sensitivity for stress testing purposes wherever appropriate. The guidelines apply to all institutions, including institutions that do not apply a very risk-sensitive approach, i.e. non-AMA institutions, are required to design a risk-sensitive stress test. If in the future the AMA is no longer in place, i.e. all institutions apply an approach that has a limited level of risk sensitivity, the stress test requirement will still remain in place for all institutions. The current guidelines might require further adoption after a new Basel regime is incorporated into EU law and endorsed, but a delay of the work on these guidelines should not be considered a viable solution.

PARAGRAPH_108243: through mergers and acquisitions, the design of new products or the development of a new business line, the severe but plausible stress test scenarios should be based on expert judgement to overcome the possible lack of historical information. Therefore, historical data and external data are only considered some of the possible information that could be used. Nevertheless, given the possible misuse of data and double- counting effect if used for both P&L and RWA projections, the guidelines could mention this aspect accordingly.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:104] [RISK:OPERATIONAL_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_108244: Two respondents mentioned that, for operational risk events to have a P&L impact, they need to have an effect on the general ledger. Neither near misses (loss amount = 0) nor loss of future earnings (which are difficult to trace back to particular operational risk events) would qualify as causing any impact on the general ledger and thus would be difficult to quantify. Therefore, they cannot be qualified as being operational risk losses with P&L impacts.

PARAGRAPH_108245: The guidelines mention that, in order to stress relevant risk parameters, institutions should use the P&L effect of operational losses as the main metric.

From the respondent point of view, 'near misses' and 'losses of future revenues' are not mandatory elements of operational risk loss data collection. Such elements of operational risk losses may be collected for operational risk management purposes by AMA banks and are not included in the scope of operational risk loss for the calculation of capital requirements for operational risk (except for material uncollected revenues, as referred to in Article 28, point (e), of the final draft regulatory technical standards (RTS) on the specification of the assessment methodology).

This is in line with the current expectations of European supervisors. Since these data are collected, it should not be an additional burden. The institutions should use the flagged positions as additional data points for the stress test calculation. The only additional burden would be a second set of calculations, but since the data collection is the more labour-intensive element, the additional calculation should be the only, limited, additional burden on IT capacity.

Further explanations of the required analysis of the so-called ‘complexity', the required analysis of 'changes to significant elements of the IT infrastructure', the required analysis of the 'complexity of processes and procedures, products and the IT system', and the required analysis of 'the susceptibility to model risks' would be very helpful. One respondent asked if the provisions of paragraph 132 mean that the P&L effect of the factors listed in points (a) to

PARAGRAPH_108264: The guidelines mention that, as operational losses may induce second-round effects (i.e. reputational risk), in order to account for such effects, the operational risk stress testing programme should be thoroughly integrated into the institution-wide stress test and should include interconnections with liquidity and own funds requirements. Institutions should analyse at least: (a) the exposure of the institution to activities and its associated risk culture and past record of operational losses, with a focus on the level and change in losses and gross income in the past few years; (b) the business environment, including geographical locations in which the institution operates and macroeconomic conditions; (c) the evolution in headcount and in balance-sheet size and complexity over the past few years, including structural changes due to corporate events such as mergers and acquisitions; (d) changes to significant elements of the information technology infrastructure; (e) the degree and orientation of incentivising in compensation schemes; (f) the complexity of processes and procedures, products and information technology systems; (g) the extent of outsourcing, with regard to the concentration risk associated with all outsourcing arrangements; and (h) the vulnerability of modelling risk, especially in the areas related to

PARAGRAPH_108275: the trading of financial instruments, risk measurement and management, and capital allocation. The previous guidelines (GL32) published in 2010 remain largely valid. The EBA understands the challenges related to the further development of stress testing programmes based on best practices and that they go beyond the status quo for many institutions. The guidelines mention that institutions should analyse at least the factors listed in items (a) to (h), so these factors need to be assessed. The stress test would not have to come up with specific effects for each of the factors, but these factors should at least be considered when determining the potential effect of a stress situation. The institution should try to assess its vulnerabilities and loss potentials, and, wherever required, it should take a forward- looking approach and it should try to assess foreseeable changes to the potentials. Institutions do not have to quantify each item, but if a relevant risk is encountered, a more detailed quantification should be done. For instance: (a) the change to significant elements of the information technology infrastructure are usually potential risks during the phase of change while its benefits are only relevant in the long term, Not all changes represent a significant effect on the exposure, but if the IT infrastructure is moved from one location to another (e.g. a different country) or if the fundamental programs or platforms are changed this might present a risk in the short term; (b) in addition to the size of an institution, its complexity is a significant driver of risk; for instance, an institution that operates in multiple jurisdictions or trades not only in standardised products but also

PARAGRAPH_108283: in self-design specialised products should assume a higher risk profile, and changes to these points might be considered additional risk potentials; (c) changes to the model usually create a model risk in the short term, but since changes to the model are predictable, an institution should be aware of a phase of increased risk. Institutions that apply internal models for pricing or capital requirement calculation might suffer from losses due to errors in the design or application of the model. Especially if an institution uses an increased number of models or uses models for an increased share of its business, the institution might suffer losses, if the model is not adequately equipped for the stress situation. The EBA recognises that institutions after the application date will continue to develop and enhance their systems and processes to meet supervisory expectations. The flexibility of implementation should be maintained by taking into account proportionality principles and the corresponding assessment of competent authorities. The EBA considers that the possible linkage between the development of employee numbers, the balance-sheet total and the operational risks is appropriate. Analysis from the supervisory as well as the industry side has shown a strong link between the size of an institution and its operational risk (especially with regard to the loss frequency). An increase in business size is therefore considered a good indicator of future risk potential. Institutions should be aware that business size might be calculated in different ways: based on the balance sheet, P&L, number of employees, etc. Double counting should be avoided (e.g. theoretically, a bank increases its business volume by 50% from one year to another, but without changing its business or other parameters, it should not double or triple count the increase in balance sheet, P&L and employees). But banks should also

Clarification would also be helpful with regard to what is meant by 'such risk factors' in the requirement in paragraph 134 to 'consider the interactions of and individual exposures to such risk factors'.

Indicatively, institutions under the AMA should stress their BEICFs. The stressing of BEICFs depends on the way in which BEICFs are designed. Even if BEICFs are used only as indicators, the institution can stress them, e.g. that a high number or all BEICFs indicate problems (i.e. as a 'traffic-light' system) and that a high number of or all scenarios need to be adapted.

With regard to point (a) of this paragraph, the respondent assumes that the guideline does not require additional impacts stemming from changing scaling factors in the stress situation to be considered. However, the respondent would welcome clarification in order to prevent false assumptions. The

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:110] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_108332: The guidelines mention that institutions should build their stress testing programmes based on both internal and external data, while analysing carefully: (a) the use of scaling factors (e.g. in a situation where external data were scaled down, the scaling may be reduced); and (b) the criteria for determining the relevance of data (e.g. data on a large loss considered not relevant may be used within the stress test). The paragraph could be changed to clarify the possible need to assess additional impacts stemming from changing scaling factors in stress situations and the use of large loss data within the stress test in addition to CRR requirements. Whenever the AMA already requires the inclusion of internal data, external data, scenarios or BEICFs the institution might have to adapt this for the stress testing. The institution might want to design the stress test in such a way that it provides the delta to the already included elements or that the original data are excluded when the modified data are included. Double counting of the same information should be avoided.

In order to avoid double counting, the respondent suggested that these risk scenarios fulfil the function of the required stress events and analysis of exposures. The respondent also mentioned the increased burden. The requirements for loss data collection in stress testing go beyond the currently existing requirements for operational risk. Compliance with these would impose a considerable implementation burden.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:111] [RISK:OPERATIONAL_RISK] [RISK:MARKET_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_108343: On its own, the AMA scenario should not be considered a stress scenario (this also applies to the market risk, where a VaR and a higher stress VaR are calculated). The stress test requirements are an additional burden on the institution, since stress testing examines a different angle from operational risk analysis. While the most burdensome element of a risk-sensitive operational risk analysis (the data collection) can be used for an AMA and for stress testing, specific modifications are necessary. Scenarios and BEICFs might be modified as well, as a collection of 'loss of future profits' is established by the stress testing. The EBA recognises that institutions after the application date will continue to develop and enhance their systems and processes to meet supervisory expectations. The flexibility of implementation should be maintained by taking into account proportionality principles and the corresponding assessment of competent authorities.

PARAGRAPH_108375: The guidelines mention that, when measuring conduct-related risk, institutions should consider (a) the uncertainty around provisions or expected losses originating from conduct-related events; and (b) extreme losses associated with tail risks (unexpected losses). Institutions should assess their capital needs under such events and scenarios and should also take into account the reputational effect of conduct losses.

PARAGRAPH_108376: The respondent believes that IAS 37 covers this. For the guidelines, the respondent would suggest replacing the final text with 'projected stressed conduct losses in excess of amounts provided for should be included in the bank's assessment of potential capital needs'. Another respondent mentioned that it should be clearly stated that the requirements specified in this paragraph are addressed to banks that do not use an internal model for computing stress tests for operational risk.

However, in the same way that section 4.7.4 Operational risk might need some fine tuning, section 4.7.5 might also require some adaptations. Reputational loss is a separate risk category from operational risk, but reputational risks can be a consequence of different risks (including operational risk) as expressed throughout the guidelines. If relevant, reputational risk should be included in ICAAP and the stress test as an individual risk category or within the limits of regulatory discretion and added to one of the other categories - deviating from the Pillar 1 definitions.

PARAGRAPH_108389: One respondent observed that paragraph 142 includes the requirement to assess the impact of changes in the expected future conduct-related risk losses to be covered by capital and the capital plan. While the respondent does not disagree with this requirement, the respondent believes that this is a general principle that covers all risks, and conduct-related risk is no different from any other risks. The respondent believes that this point is made elsewhere in the CP and if the EBA considers it necessary to state this requirement that it should do so within the general guidelines earlier in the CP. Another respondent mentioned that, as is known, future losses are duly covered by means of provisioning under accounting rules. The respondent does not consider it appropriate to assess expected losses in excess of existing accounting provisions and factor these into projections.

This requirement is mentioned to highlight the importance of the link between the possible expected losses from conduct-related risk - as part of the legal risk under the scope of operational risk - in excess of existing accounting provisions and the possible need to assess future profits to cover these additional losses or costs. In addition, it is also important to mention that such information should be clearly mentioned in institutions' capital plans.

PARAGRAPH_108404: In general, it would be appreciated if the provisioning in accounting and operational risk databases were to run in parallel. Unfortunately, the EBA has observed that accounting provisions are often only created shortly before the end of the fiscal year (this is not always sufficient for operational risk management purposes) and accounting rules often require provisions only if the probability of a loss is above 50%. A potential litigation loss of EUR 1 billion with a probability of 45% can be rejected in some accounting systems, but should be included in risk management. Additional supporting reasons are the continuous underestimation of litigation loss potentials and risks and the reluctance to account for losses especially in Anglo-Saxon litigation cases until a settlement is final.

PARAGRAPH_108445: The guidelines mention that institutions should design different time horizons in their stress testing: the time horizons should range from overnight up to at least 12 months; there should also be separate stress tests relating to intraday liquidity risk. The time horizon should display, for example, a short acute phase of stress (up to 30 days in order to cover such periods without having to change the business model) followed by a longer period of less acute but more prolonged stress (between 3 and 12 months).

PARAGRAPH_108466: Two respondents mentioned that they would welcome further clarity related to the frequency of the predicted net cash flows to ensure appropriate application.

PARAGRAPH_108467: The guidelines mention that the main methodology used for calculating the magnitude of the impact should be the net cash flow profile. For each scenario, at each stress level, the institution identifies cash inflows and outflows that are projected for each future time period and the resulting net cash flows. Institutions should consider the lowest cumulative point of net cash flows within the time period assessed in each given scenario. The EBA considers that the guidelines need to allow a sufficient degree of discretion and should not set out specific requirements regarding the frequency of cash flows, since these should be determined based on individual portfolio and business model characteristics.

Another respondent mentioned that it would welcome clarity regarding the definition of the counterbalancing effects provided by central banks (monetary policy).

PARAGRAPH_108530: One respondent mentioned that, with regard to concentration risk, correlations between risk factors are to be increased and extreme changes in risk parameters are to be stressed, taking into account second-round effects in the process (paragraph 172). Such deliverables can only be computed on a statistically uncertain basis and do not lead to more acceptance of stress testing among decision-makers in institutions.

The respondent mentions also that the implementation of the Guidelines on capital measures for foreign currency lending to unhedged borrowers under the SREP (paragraph 9) is required from a materiality threshold of 10%: 'These guidelines apply on an institution-by-institution basis wherever the following threshold of materiality is met: Loans denominated in foreign currency to unhedged borrowers constitute at least 10 % of an institution's total loan book (total loans to non-financial corporations and households), where such total loan book constitutes at least 25 % of the institution's total assets.' Only once this

PARAGRAPH_108550: The guidelines mention that institutions should take into account that FX lending risk: (a) may arise from the unhedged borrower's inability to service debt denominated in currencies other than the currency of the Member State in which the institution has been authorised; (b) is related to pure credit and FX market risk; (c) is characterised by a non-linear relationship of credit and FX market risk components; (d) is influenced by the general exchange rate risk; and (e) may arise from conduct-related risk. The EBA GL/2013/02 was repealed with effect from 1 January 2016. However the concept was included in EBA/GL/2014/13. The EBA considers that the paragraph could be clarified to specify that 'unhedged borrower' means 'retail and SME borrowers without a natural or financial hedge which are exposed to a currency mismatch between the loan currency and the hedge currency', as defined in EBA/GL/2014/13. The EBA considers that the guidelines need to allow a sufficient degree of discretion when institutions set out the materiality to determine whether FX lending risk is relevant for institutions, so no minimum threshold is defined.

PARAGRAPH_108561: One respondent understands that the intention behind the guidance on this matter is in light of certain experiences by certain institutions in some countries. The respondent is of the opinion that these matters are best dealt within the modelling of the input values, PD, LGD, EaD and thus the guidelines on these matters should be incorporated where appropriate in other RTS. Two respondents mentioned that according to paragraph 182(e) IRB approach models should reflect FX risks by increased risk weights. The respondent mentioned that such a requirement would need to be formulated in the CRR rather than in a stress guideline and should be deleted in the guidelines given that CRR is not addressing this requirement.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:123] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_108562: The guidelines mention that when stress testing the FX lending risk, institutions should take into account at least: (a) the type of exchange rate regime and how this could impact on the evolution of the FX rate between domestic and foreign currencies; (b) the sensitivity impact of exchange rate movements on the borrower's credit rating/score and debt servicing capacity; (c) the potential concentrations of lending activity in a single foreign currency or in a limited number of highly correlated foreign currencies; (d) the potential concentrations of lending activity in some specific sectors of the economy, in the country currency, and the corresponding evolution of such sectors highly correlated with foreign currencies; and (e) the ability to secure financing for this type of portfolio. For institutions applying internal models for the calculation of credit risk capital requirements, the additional risk related to lending in FX currencies should be reflected in higher risk weights of such assets. The non-exhaustive list of variables used in the models should include interest rates disparities, loan LTV, currency cross correlation and volatility. The EBA considers that some items could, indeed, possibly be dealt with within the modelling areas. However, the guidelines need to mention these items in a broader way, and not just as specifically incorporated through modelling and risk parameters such as PD, LGDs, EADs, etc. Among many reasons, many

' Although the respondent agrees with the guidelines that recovery planning and reverse stress testing for ICAAP and ILAAP purposes should not be interlinked, the respondent encourages a review of the guidelines with respect to the mixing of ICAAP and ILAAP as set out in section 4.8.1. - Application of stress testing programmes. The respondent's preference is for the EBA to provide guidance for institutions on how to develop consistent scenarios that stress liquidity and capital separately and then to assess the overall impact. This may allow an assessment of where vulnerabilities may be. One respondent mentioned that it would appreciate a rephrasing of this paragraph to restrict legal entity stress requirements to the most significant entities only. Global SIBs in particular face having: (a) many legal entities; and (b) entities that do not operate under the consolidated group regime but operate under the local regulatory framework. As a consequence, a simple breakdown of group level stress results into results for all legal entities is not only tedious but does not generate the locally required metrics. The respondent would suggest that the EBA reconsider this requirement.

PARAGRAPH_108593: The EBA considers that the section 4.8.1., Stress testing for ICAAP/ILAAP purposes, does not require stress tests to be conducted in which liquidity and capital stresses interact and may result in feedback loops. The section does not mention any need for interlinkage between ICAAP and ILAAP to estimate corresponding impacts. The principle of proportionality is recognised and applies to all aspects of these guidelines, including the methodology, as well as the frequency and the degree of detail of the stress tests. The Background and rationale section and Part 4 - Institutions' stress testing - contain very clear statements on proportionality instead of restricting the guidelines to the most significant entities only.

PARAGRAPH_108611: Another respondent mentioned that paragraph 187, point (c), for globally active institutions that also have to use ICAAP in the APAC region, the requirement to perform ‘comprehensive institution-wide stress testing ... reflecting all entities' poses considerable problems. The APAC ICAAP is, as has been demonstrated, locally subject to other rules that are not compatible with the European approach. Should European and APAC rules not be aligned, the respondent requested deletion of this paragraph. The same respondent mentioned that, in paragraph 187, point (d), a minimum period for ICAAP stress tests makes no sense because the ICAAP should cover all overarching scenarios, in addition to those with a rapid impact. At best, a requirement to at least assess a scenario with a minimum duration of two years makes sense. In addition, it should be explained how the two-year time horizon is to be understood. Does it mean a rolling period of two years from the date on which the stress test is set up, the next two accounting reference dates, or the earliest future accounting reference date that is more than two years after the date of the stress test?
