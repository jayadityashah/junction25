PARAGRAPH_160082: If the elements remain undelivered due to the contractor's delay at the time when the price or part of it is due for payment under the contract, the customer has the right to withhold payment until the delivery takes place. If the delivery is only delayed in part, the customer shall not, however, withhold any amount of the price that manifestly exceeds the claims to which the customer has the right on the basis of the delay. Even after any delivery, the customer has the right to withhold the payment of a part of the price necessary to secure any claim for compensation based on a delay.

If the elements subject to the contract must be manufactured or acquired specifically for the buyer in accordance with the buyer's instructions or wishes and the contractor cannot without significant financial loss make use of them in other ways, the customer may not terminate the contract unless the delay has lasted for more than 60 days. The customer may, however, terminate the contract already before the delay has lasted for 60 days if the customer would be placed in an unreasonable situation due to the customer having to remain in the contract.
