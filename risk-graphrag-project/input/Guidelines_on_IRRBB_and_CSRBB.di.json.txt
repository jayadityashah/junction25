[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3] [RISK:MARKET_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_87525: Article 84(6) of the Directive 2013/36/EU1 (Capital Requirements Directive - CRD) mandates the EBA to issue Guidelines to specify the criteria for the evaluation by an institution's internal system of the interest rate risk of an institution's non-trading book activities (IRRBB) as well as the criteria for the identification, management and mitigation by institutions of the IRRBB either if it implements internal systems, the standardised approach or the simplified standardised approach.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3] [RISK:MARKET_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_87526: The EBA published in July 2018 Guidelines "on the management of interest rate risk arising from non-trading book activities" ("the 2018 Guidelines") that apply from June 2019 with dedicated provisions on these aspects. The current Guidelines replace the 2018 EBA Guidelines as some of its parts will be covered by dedicated RTS and the amended mandate includes new aspects as explained below. These new Guidelines maintain continuity with the previous Guidelines as far as possible, while updating some elements.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_87527: The Guidelines are broadly consistent with the Basel standards with some further elaborated sections following the CRD mandate, particularly on CSRBB assessment and monitoring and non- satisfactory IRRBB internal systems.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_87528: The EBA is mandated to specify in these Guidelines additional criteria for the assessment and monitoring by institutions of their credit spread risk arising from their non-trading book activities (CSRBB). The Guidelines provide a definition and the scope of application of CSRBB. They contain dedicated sections for CSRBB with specific provisions on the identification, assessment and monitoring of CSRBB.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_87529: Finally, the mandate requests the inclusion of criteria for determining whether the internal systems implemented by institutions for the purpose of evaluating IRRBB are not satisfactory, in which case a competent authority may require an institution to use the standardised methodology.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_87530: After some general provisions, the Guidelines contain separate specific chapters for IRRBB and for CSRBB.

PARAGRAPH_87544: 1. On 18 July 2018 the EBA issued Guidelines on the management of interest rate risk arising from non-trading book activities. They updated the previous EBA Guidelines from 22 May 2015 and set up the first phase to implement within the EU the Standards on interest rate risk in the banking book published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS Standards) in April 2016.2

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_87545: 2. The second phase of the implementation of the Basel Standards within the EU takes place with the revision of Directive 2013/36/EU3 (Capital Requirements Directive - CRD) and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (Capital Requirements Regulation - CRR) and the upcoming enactment of a number of technical standards that the EBA is mandated to draft in the revised CRD and CRR.

PARAGRAPH_87546: 3. Paragraph 1 of Article 84 of Directive 2013/36/EU establishes that institutions shall use either internal systems, the standardised methodology or the simplified standardised methodology4 to identify, evaluate, manage and mitigate interest rate risk of an institution's non-trading book activities. Paragraph 3 empowers competent authorities to require an institution the use of the standardised methodology to evaluate that risk where its internal systems for the purposes of such evaluation are not satisfactory.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_87547: 4. In this context, Directive 2013/36/EU sets out a number of mandates to the EBA, namely:

PARAGRAPH_87552: 4 The simplified standardised methodology is envisaged for small and non-complex institution as defined in point (145) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. However, following paragraph 4 of Article 84 Directive 2013/36/EU, competent authorities may require them to use the standardised methodology if the simplified standardised methodology is not adequate to capture interest rate risk arising from non-trading book activities. The mandate for these Guidelines does not encompass the assessment of this adequacy.

PARAGRAPH_87559: (c) As per point (b) of paragraph 6 of Article 84 of Directive 2013/36/EU, these Guidelines will specify the criteria to identify, manage and mitigate interest rate risk of an institution's non-trading book activities if the institutions implement internal systems or use the standardised methodology or the simplified standardised methodology. In this context Sections 4.2 and 4.3 of these Guidelines specify the necessary criteria for this.

PARAGRAPH_87561: 6. Following point (c) of paragraph 6 of Article 84 Directive 2013/36/EU these Guidelines will include criteria to specify how to assess and monitor the credit spread risk on an institution's non-trading book. In this regard, sections 4.5 and 4.6 of the Guidelines provide a definition of the risk, the identification of the perimeter of exposures to this risk as well as guiding principles for its assessment and monitoring.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_87562: 7. In summary, these Guidelines provide the legal framework for institutions' IRRBB internal systems and for the supervisory outlier tests (SOT) calculations if not specified in the relevant Regulatory Technical Standards on SOT. The Guidelines are also applicable, as regards the identification, management and mitigation of IRRBB, in case the internal systems are replaced by the use of the IRRBB standardised methodology (SA), in which case the relevant Regulatory Technical Standards on SA provide the necessary specifications for IRRBB evaluation aspects as well as for the purposes of SOT calculations if not specified in the relevant Regulatory Technical Standards on SOT.6 The Guidelines also provide the legal framework for assessing and monitoring CSRBB.

PARAGRAPH_87564: 8. The Guidelines are strongly inspired by the 2018 EBA Guidelines on the management of interest rate risk arising from non-trading book activities. As explained in the following paragraphs, these Guidelines generally maintain continuity to the 2018 Guidelines in the identification, management and measurement of IRRBB under internal systems. However, some new elements are introduced like prudent behavioral assumption on non-maturity deposits from non-financial counterparties. The Guidelines also incorporate criteria to identify non-satisfactory IRRBB internal systems and add specific chapters to CSRBB identification, assessment and monitoring.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]

PARAGRAPH_87572: 10.Furthermore, in this context, a five years cap on weighted average repricing maturity is introduced now for certain retail and wholesale deposits without a specified maturity. This behavioural assumption targets prudent treatment of these deposits which prove to be a material item in the calculation of the impact of changes of interest rates.

PARAGRAPH_87573: 11.In the determination of non-satisfactory IRRBB internal systems implemented by institutions, the Guidelines seek to provide minimum specific criteria to be assessed by the relevant competent authority. This approach targets to ensure that minimum harmonised criteria are used for these purposes while ensuring competent authorities' 'may' power to require the application of the standardised approach as envisaged in paragraph 3 of Article 84 Directive 2013/36/EU remains and any automatism here is avoided. The referred specific criteria mainly build on the compliance with the Guidelines and on a minimum comprehensive management of IRRBB that should be guaranteed.

PARAGRAPH_87574: 12. These Guidelines elaborate on the definition of CSRBB following the provisions of the Basel rules text. In the identification of the perimeter of application, the Guidelines include assets recognised at fair value as well as any other assets, liabilities or off-balance sheet items that can be exposed to CSRBB. The Guidelines elaborate on the expected assessment and monitoring of CSRBB in the context of adequate and proportionate governance related aspects, processes to identify, manage, monitor and report and internal control mechanisms as envisaged by paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 74 of Directive 2013/36/EU.

In this context, particular attention will be paid to the 5-year repricing maturity cap and the repricing approaches used in business lines and products. The EBA will liaise with competent authorities and institutions as far as needed, and with the view to assess any potential unintended or undesirable effect.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:19] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_87780: 22. When evaluating the amounts, types and distributions of internal capital pursuant to Article 73 of Directive 2013/36/EU, institutions should base the contribution of IRRBB to the overall internal capital assessment on the institution's internal measurement systems outputs, taking account of key assumptions and risk limits. The overall level of capital should be commensurate with both the institution's actual measured level of risk (including for IRRBB) and its risk appetite, and be duly documented in its report on the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP report).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:19] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_87781: 23.Institutions should demonstrate that their internal capital is commensurate with the level of IRRBB, taking into account the impact on internal capital of potential changes in the institution's economic value and future net interest income measures plus market value changes resulting from changes in interest rates. Institutions should evaluate IRRBB risk measures in their internal capital determination particularly noting that the IRRBB measures capture the risk in a complementary manner (e.g., considering IRRBB from a different time horizon). Institutions are not expected to double-count their internal capital for EV and net interest income measures plus market value changes, nonetheless the internal capital allocation methodology should consider both IRRBB risk measures and explicitly assess their potential impact on internal capital.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:19]
PARAGRAPH_87782: 24.In their ICAAP analysis of the amount of internal capital required for IRRBB, institutions should consider:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:19]
PARAGRAPH_87785: 25.Institutions should not only rely on the supervisory assessments of capital adequacy for IRRBB or on the outcome of the supervisory outlier test, but should develop and use their own methodologies for capital allocation, based on their risk appetite, level of risk and risk management policies. In determining the appropriate level of capital, institutions should consider both the amount and the quality of capital needed.

PARAGRAPH_88043: 90.Institutions should consider whether to apply a conditional or unconditional cash flow modelling approach. Larger and more complex institutions, in particular institutions under categories 1 and 2 of the SREP Guidelines, should also take into account scenarios where different interest rate paths are computed and where some of the assumptions (e.g., relating to behaviour, contribution to risk, and balance sheet size and composition) are themselves functions of changing interest rate levels.

PARAGRAPH_88044: 91.Institutions should assess exposures in each currency in which they have positions. For the material currency exposures, the interest rate shock scenarios should be currency-specific and consistent with the underlying economic characteristics. Under the IRRBB internal measurement system (IMS), currency-specific interest rate shock scenarios, should be considered, at least, for each currency where the accounting value of financial assets or liabilities denominated in a currency amounts to 5% or more of the total non-trading book financial assets or liabilities, or less than 5% if the sum of financial assets or liabilities included in the calculation is lower than 90% of total non-trading book financial assets (excluding tangible assets) or liabilities. Institutions should include in their internal measurement systems methods to aggregate their IRRBB across different currencies. Where institutions make use of assumptions about dependencies between interest rates in different currencies, they should have the necessary level of skills and sophistication to do so. Institutions should take into account the impact of assumptions regarding dependencies between interest rates across different currencies.

PARAGRAPH_88168: 121. CSRBB does not include the effect of credit quality changes during the observation period (i.e., rating category downgrade/upgrade of a specific counterparty or instrument, considered as migration risk). In particular, the deterioration of an institution's credit quality should not have any positive impact on the credit spread risk measure. Institutions should avoid any overlap with the credit valuation adjustment risk management framework when assessing the CSRBB.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:58] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_88597: 1. Article 16(2) of the EBA Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council) provides that, where appropriate, the EBA should analyse 'the related potential costs and benefits' of Guidelines issued by the EBA. Such analysis shall be proportionate in relation to the scope, nature and impact of the Guidelines. The following section provides an impact assessment of the Guidelines. It includes an overview of the findings regarding the problems to be dealt with, options available to tackle the problems, and cost-benefit analysis compared with the baseline scenario.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:58] [RISK:MARKET_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_88598: 2. Following paragraph 6 of Article 84 Directive 2013/36/EU, the Guidelines cover a wide number of items included in the EBA/GL/2018/02, Guidelines on the management of interest rate risk arising from non-trading book activities published on 18 July 2018 and generally applicable from 30 June 2019. Therefore, the items related to the identification, management and evaluation of IRRBB are maintained, with slight amendments as appropriate, and expanded to CSRBB to the extent that deemed necessary. These Guidelines mainly introduce a further developed analysis of the definition and perimeter of the CSRBB. Thus, this impact assessment focuses on these abovementioned aspects. The analysis is mainly of qualitative nature but also builds on the QIS data collection during the first half of 2021 where some quantitative input on CSRBB has been collected.

PARAGRAPH_88602: 3. CSRBB relates to the changes of market credit and market liquidity spreads as components of the yield (curve) for instruments of a specific credit worthiness/rating. They are considered as a general market risk premium paid to access the capital markets and pricing of instruments.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:58]
PARAGRAPH_88603: 4. More specifically the CSRBB targets to capture the changes of the "market credit spread" and the changes of the "market liquidity spread". It does not include the effect of rating changes situations during the observation period or instruments under default situation. This is illustrated as follows:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:59] [RISK:LIQUIDITY_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_88615: 6. The argument to include some idiosyncratic elements here is that they would not be covered in other risk framework. For example, under Option 1, the CSRBB in the case of a AAA bond would be explained by the changes in the spread of the bond, remaining as AAA, due to market credit and market liquidity reasons. However, in the definition proposed under Option 2, the CSRBB would also be explained by idiosyncratic factors that are not covered in other risk framework. This is illustrated as follows:

PARAGRAPH_88631: 7. Under Option A institutions should not exclude any instruments in the banking book from the perimeter of CSRBB ex ante. Any potential exclusion of instruments from the relevant perimeter should be appropriately documented. The perimeter is not dependent on accounting treatment, but rather on sensitivity of an instruments to credit spread changes. The deterioration of a bank's creditworthiness should not have any positive impact on the credit spread risk measure.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:60]
PARAGRAPH_88632: 8. In summary, in order to derive the relevant perimeter of instruments subject to credit spread volatility, institutions should perform a top-down approach of their own:

PARAGRAPH_88645: 13.From the data received, banks consider that their CSRBB exposures are concentrated in the asset side and particularly in debt securities. On average, CSRBB exposures in the form of debt securities represent more than 90% of all the assets exposed to CSRBB. Still, it is relevant to show that banks report liabilities exposed to CSRBB, mainly under the categories of debt securities issued and other liabilities, including deposits taken.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:61] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_88646: 14.In addition to this, the QIS participating banks report that, on average, almost all (more than 99%) of their debt securities exposed to CSRBB are accounted at fair value.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:61]
PARAGRAPH_88647: 15.Most of the debt securities exposed to CSRBB (on average, 77%), are instruments whose pricing is based on direct market observation, i.e. instruments that can be priced using quoted prices, or quoted prices of financial instruments with similar characteristics.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:61]
PARAGRAPH_88648: 16.The EBA requested banks to provide the own qualitative assessment, as per their degree of CSRBB exposure, in the scale between 0% to 100%, for all their exposure categories. Debt securities in the asset side estimated, on average, at 48%. Participants also provide a similar assessment on other asset categories, such as securitisations, debt securities and credit derivatives, on the liability side.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:61]
PARAGRAPH_88649: 17.Banks also provided data on the impact of a 1 basis point parallel upward shift of the credit spread curve on the present value of the respective exposures. Generally, the impact reported is negligible except for some outlier.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:61]
PARAGRAPH_88650: 18.On a more qualitative basis, 12 out of 23 banks, explained that in their current assessment and monitoring of CSRBB exposures they include, but find it difficult to disentangle, the idiosyncratic component. This is a relevant input for the exception envisaged in the Guidelines for including idiosyncratic elements in the monitoring of CSRBB as long as the results are more conservative.

PARAGRAPH_88651: 19.30 out of 40 banks explained that they apply internal limits on exposures to CSRBB. Generally, banks explained that they reduce their positions when breaching the limits rather than setting up hedging strategies.

PARAGRAPH_88652: 5.1.3 Final option

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:61]
PARAGRAPH_88653: 20. The EBA takes note that the majority of the exposures to CSRBB, as communicated by banks, are in the form of debt securities in the asset side and accounted at fair value. The EBA understands that this might be very much linked to the fact that the current EBA GL on IRRBB and the EBA GL on SREP envisage precisely this exposure category in the CSRBB framework16.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:61] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_88654: 16 Paragraph 18 of the EBA GL on IRRBB states that "Institutions should monitor and assess their CSRBB-affected exposures, by reference to the asset side of the non-trading book, where CSRBB is relevant for the risk profile of the institution."

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:61]
PARAGRAPH_88655: Paragraph 4 of the EBA GL on SREP provide a definition of 'Credit spread risk' as "the risk arising from changes in the market value of debt financial instruments due to fluctuations in their credit spread."

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:62]
PARAGRAPH_88658: 21.Based on this, the EBA understands that assets at fair value constitute a category that should always be included in the perimeter of CSRBB. This is in line with the current GL and also has practical evidence. This also provides a minimum harmonisation in the definition of the perimeter.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:62] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_88659: 22.However, the EBA considers that CSRBB exposures should not be confined upfront to these categories only. Indeed, and despite the perimeter in the current EBA GL, banks report other categories as exposed to CSRBB in practice and therefore banks should pay attention to all potential exposures to CSRBB irrespective of the asset or liability category they are. For these reasons the EBA opts for Policy option B for the definition of the perimeter.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:62] [RISK:LIQUIDITY_RISK] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_88660: 23.As regards the definition of CSRBB itself, the EBA considers that idiosyncratic elements should not be included since they are generally covered in other risk framework, mainly the credit risk. Considering these elements in the definition could trigger double counting issues. Also from a conceptual perspective, CSRBB is purely market related and therefore market and liquidity related elements should conform its definition. Nevertheless, after accounting for proportionality aspects and the qualitative QIS input mentioned in the previous item, the GL envisage some flexibility in the treatment of idiosyncratic elements, as long as the results would become more conservative. This is a good balance in the implementation between the pure definition of CSRBB and the operational difficulties that some banks might find in disentangling the idiosyncratic elements of credit spread risk.

PARAGRAPH_88670: The EBA has continued working on the draft Guidelines during the consultation period. The EBA ensures continuity with the approach in place in the current 2018 Guidelines17 and in line with the Basel standards to ensure that internal systems implemented by institutions to identify, evaluate, manage and mitigate their exposures to IRRBB take into account the impact on economic value of equity and the net interest income of their non-trading book activities. Particularly, in the net interest income perspective, the Guidelines consider the impact on interest income and interest expenses but also includes supervisory expectations to consider market value changes of instruments at fair value under such analysis. The same applies when it comes to the envisaged assessment and monitoring of CSRBB.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:63]
PARAGRAPH_88671: Feedback from respondents was received on the five years repricing maturity cap for non-maturity deposits, some of them expressing concerns on the impact that it might cause on some specific business models and arguing under internal systems institutions should be allowed to fully model behavioural assumption. Others argued that if understood as an average applied to the full amount of non-maturity deposits the impact is not expected to trigger unintended consequences.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:63]
PARAGRAPH_88672: The Guidelines envisage that behavioural assumptions should be applied in the measurement of IRRBB exposures. The EBA considers that proportionality should be taken into account here and refers to the materiality thresholds in the determination of these assumptions as established in the upcoming regulatory technical standards envisaged in Article 84(5) of the CRD for the specification of the standardised approach.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_88676: The EBA clarifies also that the five years cap envisaged in the modelling of the repricing maturity under internal systems for retail and non-financial wholesale deposits should be applied as an average to the full amount, core and non-core, of the cited non-maturity deposits. These specificities are expected to also limit the impact of this unique behavioural assumption related specification in the Guidelines. In addition to this the EBA, consistently with other pieces of the regulatory framework and corresponding provisions from the CRR, recognises some exceptions to the cap to specific regulated products. That said, given the current lack of experience with the application of the 5 years cap under internal systems, as a difference with the previous Guidelines on the management of interest risk arising from non-trading book activities published in 2018, the EBA will exercise a close monitoring of the implementation of this behavioural assumption and potential undesirable effects.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_88677: Some respondents argued that the CSRBB perimeter should be limited to marketable assets at fair value. The EBA would like to clarify that the proposed framework seeks to cover the credit spread risk both from an EVE and NII perspective - in line with the CRD mandate - and not only under normal, but also under exceptional and stressed situations. Therefore, the EBA does not rule out a priori any banking book item from the perimeter of CSRBB. It corresponds to institutions to demonstrate which items are credit spread risk non-sensitive except assets accounted at fair value that should also be included in the perimeter.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_88678: The EBA would also like to clarify that the intention of the Guidelines is to exclude non-performing exposures, rather than those under default only, due to the inherent complexities of assessing credit spreads in non-performing exposures and in order to ensure comparability. A relevant amendment has been made.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_88679: Some respondents requested for proportionality in the criteria to identify non-satisfactory internal systems and asked for clarification on potential direct implications to apply the standardized approach. The EBA clarifies that proportionality is indeed envisaged in the Guidelines and for the purposes of this analysis and also that it does not correspond to the Guidelines to refer to the specific actions in case of non-satisfactory internal systems whose determination is reserved to supervisors only in the CRD either by requiring the application of the standardized approach or other remedies envisaged in the CRD.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_88680: In CSRBB governance related aspects some feedback was received to apply an approach similar as the envisaged for IRRBB with regards to delegation of responsibilities. The EBA assesses that indeed this delegation of power should be similar for the IRRBB and CSRBB frameworks.

The EBA wishes to clarify that the term market value changes refer only to market value changes that will be reflected when risk-free interest rates shift. A few respondents acknowledged that even when hedge accounting should be included, accounting ineffectiveness cannot be calculated a priori. The EBA would also like to clarify that as changes in interest rates are reflected in items accounted at fair value, ineffectiveness per se is not considered, only accounting asymmetries.

They consider that modelling behavioural assumptions is inherent to an internal management system, with the best knowledge clients' profiles, deposit type, geographical aspects ... and that, therefore, it should not be standardised in the GL. Furthermore, they argue that the 5 years cap is not supported by empirical observations. Some respondents disagree with excluding NMDs from financial customers from behavioural assumptions, meaning to be modelled as overnight, since in their view they show some stability to be modelled serving as hedge for long- term loans.

It is argued that, in the cases of retail deposits for saving purposes with high stability, posing a cap would not lead to a prudent management of the interest rate risk exposure, but to a structural under-hedge (or shorter investment of assets), which exposes the bank to the risk of decreasing interest rates.

It is also argued that this cap would be particularly inaccurate for the operational deposits of custody and trust banks, as the majority of their deposits do not have contractual maturities and are from financial customers. These financial customers maintain a stable level of deposits at custody and trust banks to ensure that the bank can carry out day-to-day payment, settlement, and other operational services for the customer.

PARAGRAPH_88770: IMS are considered as non-satisfactory. This should be considered in the context where many answers underlined the SA could be more resource intensive to deliver than the requirement to remediate non- satisfactory internal model targeted and limited weaknesses. For respondents, corrective measures on IRRBB IMS should always be privileged to the supervisory requirement to apply the SA for the computation of the IRRBB. Some respondents suggested the Guidelines to specify the timeline to move from the IRRBB IMS to the IRRBB SA. Answers called for a reasonable period to remedy identified IRRBB IMS weaknesses before being obliged to move to IRRBB SA (i.e. transitional period, clear and straightforward road map for reverting to a (satisfactory) internal system). Some respondents suggested the framework should define under which conditions a return to IRRBB IMS should be allowed for banks obliged to use the SA. Indeed, once identified shortcomings have been remedied, it should be possible for an institution to revert to an IRRBB IMS without undue delay. Some respondents suggested to clarify in the Guidelines that the SA is considered a fallback solution and not as a benchmark for assessing if the IRRBB IMS is satisfactory or not. Institutions should not be expected to justify why they consider their IRRBB IMS is better than the IRRBB SA.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:71]
PARAGRAPH_88781: For small and non-complex institutions and banks with simple IRRBB exposure, respondents called for the definition of minimum elements for supervisors' assessment of non-satisfactory IRRBB IMS. One respondent underlined for proportionality purposes the separate assessment of basis risk, option risk and gap risk under paragraph 119(a) should not be a condition to differentiate satisfactory from non-satisfactory IRRBB IMS. Some answers underline the extensive requirements for the "review" as well as "validation" of the IRRBB IMS would represent a disproportionate effort for small banks (in particular the isolation of effects resulting from behavioral assumptions or the analysis of elasticities). Respondents suggested to introduce simplifications and adjustments in line with the underlying moderate IRRBB risk materiality of small and non- complex institutions. Paragraph 119(b) appears too detailed for some respondents as the modeling framework is already referred in paragraphs 71 to 79 [paragraphs 70 to 78 of the final guidelines]. It is also potentially misleading as it may be understood as requiring each single parameter to be subject to back-testing rather than models as a whole, and as some assumptions are necessarily discretionary (e.g., choice of the duration of equity).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:71]
PARAGRAPH_88782: Proportionality is envisaged as a general rule in the analysis of satisfactory internal systems. Paragraph 118 is clear that "As a minimum, satisfactory internal systems should be implemented in compliance with these Guidelines, taking into account the principle of proportionality". This is even reinforced in some specific aspect like in point b of paragraph 119 where the calibration, back testing and review of all the relevant parameters should be made "on an appropriate frequency and supported by a due governance and documentation that considers the nature, scale and complexity of the IRRBB inherent in the business model and the institution's activities." The EBA considers that, in point b of paragraph 119, that the calibration, back testing and review "in all the relevant parameters" should be read as in the internal model as a whole and not on every single parameter individually necessarily.

PARAGRAPH_88793: Under paragraph 119(a) some respondents asked the EBA to define the concept of "economically justified manner" in the phrase "An IMS should be considered non-satisfactory [ ... ] on a case-by-case basis, that the implemented methods [ ... ] do not capture in a robust and economically justified manner all material dimensions of risks" Some respondents underlined it is not always clear where the criteria apply to "internal models" only (i.e., behavioural models) or to the "internal measurement system" (of which internal models are part). In particular, it was underlined that the governance, the strategy and the risk assessment framework are not defined under the IRRBB SA framework, which imply the requirements defined for the purpose of IRRBB IMS also apply to IRRBB SA and S-SA. As such IRRBB governance, strategy and risk assessment cannot be considered as criteria for the identification of non-satisfactory IRRBB IMS. For all these reasons the concept of "internal models" should be privileged to the concept of "internal measurement system". Indeed, only the internal models should be subject to "calibration" and "back testing procedures" and not the outcomes of the methods listed in Annex I. For the purpose of paragraph 119(b) some respondents underlined it is not clear what is meant by "calibrated" and "reviewed". They also asked who is supposed to be reviewing what (i.e., risk controlling, internal audit, ... ). Under paragraph 119 respondents suggested it would also make more

PARAGRAPH_88794: The EBA considers that the wording "economically justified manner" can be deleted in avoidance of confusion. Its target was only to ensure that economic fundaments and rationale were considered in the analysis of whether measures capture all material dimensions of risks for significant assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet type instruments. However, this might be understood implicitly in the analysis. Paragraph 63 [paragraph 62 of the final guidelines] of the draft Guidelines asks for consistency between the IRRBB and the financial planning set up by the bank which is based on economic forecasts. As such, the economic consistency of the IRRBB risk indicator cannot be discarded. As per point (b) of paragraph 6 of Article 84 of Directive 2013/36/EU, these Guidelines will specify the criteria to identify, manage and mitigate interest rate risk of an institution's non-trading book activities if the institutions implement internal systems or use the standardised methodology or the simplified standardised methodology. In point (d) of such paragraph the Guidelines are envisaged to provide the criteria for determining if the internal systems are not satisfactory. The CRD refers literally to internal systems. The fact that the same rules on Governance in the Guidelines apply to banks implementing an internal system or applying the standardised approach or the simplified standardised approach does not impede

Respondents seem to argue that by requiring the application of the standardised approach in this case the same flaws would remain. It should be noted that requiring the application of the standardised approach is just a possible solution that a competent authority might take but it is also possible for the supervisor to decide to require a remedy to a specific flaw that might be observed in governance, for example, in order to keep an improved internal system as necessary. The EBA would like to clarify that as indicated in the draft Guidelines and in line with the EBA/GL/2018/02 on the management of IRRBB, the review and validation on the internal systems should be read in the context of paragraphs 71 to 79 [paragraphs 70 to 78 of the final guidelines].

PARAGRAPH_88821: For consistency with the Pillar 2 general spirit, some answers recalled the freedom of methods should prevail for the monitoring of CSRBB. The future EBA Guidelines on CSRBB should be "method-neutral". It should be possible for institutions to satisfy the NII and EVE requirements for the monitoring of CSRBB with the help of both scenario-based and VaR-based Internal Measurement Systems, for instance. On the contrary other respondents asked the EBA to further clarify or provide examples on the methodology to monitor the impact of CSRBB on EVE and NII. They fears the lack of well-established common practices, as well as of reliable market data for non-marketable instruments, might lead to very heterogeneous analysis frameworks among banks, hampering comparability of outcomes. One respondent suggested the usefulness to define a standard methodology for CSRBB on how this should be handled (eg. sensitivity to a 1bp independently from correlation with other risk factors).

Practically, the respondent does not monitor these as they are irrelevant to the institution's business. Unless yield data are readily available, it requires insight into the underlying portfolio and cash flows from it to derive yields and risk premiums. Furthermore, the use of indices compiled on ratings assigned by rating agencies ignores any criticism on past failure to capture credit deteriorations and the sticky nature of such ratings.

PARAGRAPH_88897: the perimeter of CSRBB an extension of the Basel standards. CSRRBB assessment for liquid assets at fair value is also deemed the most common banking practice. Several respondents consider there is the need to ensure consistency with the business model of the institution, where amortized cost items - including market/liquid debt securities held in a collect mode - must be excluded as not intended to be sold before maturity. One respondent suggests including items at amortized cost overlaps with the credit risk assessment and the credit risk Pillar 1 requirements. Some respondents admit credit spread risk could materialize in amortized cost items - either bonds, loans or deposits - if they were sold/transferred in exceptional cases such as during mergers and acquisition processes, under cases of business model reclassifications or under stressed conditions, such us a resolution scenario. Some respondents consider credit spread changes in the market irrelevant to the conditions applicable to private mortgage lending and deposits whose margin (administrative rate) is under control of the bank, and recommend mentioning explicitly that Loans and Deposits are excluded from the scope of CSRBB. Others raise doubts and ask for examples on how the CSRBB could be assessed for these kind of products. One respondent suggests that in contrast to the EVE approach, from an NII perspective, the scope of

However, the EBA does not rule out other non-trading book assets as well as liabilities, including bank's own liabilities, that may be exposed to CSRBB. As per paragraph 124, any exclusion of products from the EVE or NII perimeter should be demonstrated to be insensitive to CSRBB. The EBA acknowledges that in practice decomposing credit spread rates into theoretical components may be conceptually challenging, more in particular for institutions seeking advanced methodologies for the assessment of CSRBB. The EBA wishes to clarify that the reason in providing guidance on this matter is for excluding the idiosyncratic credit spread as to avoid overlap with the credit risk framework. The EBA wishes to clarify that the general market- credit and market-liquidity spreads are not intended to capture the specifics of the credit instruments (either bonds, loans or other kind of "marketable" or "non-marketable" instrument), as these are expected to be part of the idiosyncratic credit spread, according to definition. Moreover, a separate assessment of market-credit and market- liquidity spreads is not suggested, nor particularly limited, by the CSRBB framework.

A few respondents suggest leaving at the consideration of banks the potential inclusion of products different than fair value assets according to the identification or existence of CSRBB. Some respondents ask whether CSRBB risks from the asset and liability side must be assessed separately or in a net basis, and suggest providing guidance on this matter. One respondent asked for further clarification on the expectations of paragraph 159 [paragraph 158 of the final guidelines]. where it is mentioned that institutions should, in relation to both economic value and net interest income based measures of CSRRBB, take into account the implications of accounting practices for the measurement of CSRBB, and in particular hedge-accounting effectiveness.

From an NII perspective, and again in the context of the provisions related to the monitoring of CSRBB (section 4.6), institutions might assess certain products (e.g., Loans, deposits) where the margins in new business are under control of the bank and consider if it may be reasonable to introduce other drivers or assumptions which reflect potential lower correlations between administered rate margins and general market spreads.

One respondent considers that with a wide perimeter, CSRBB mitigants could significantly impact the credit creation given that they can't be managed via financial instruments. One respondent expects a considerable increase in the costs of compliance (e.g compliance of mitigation actions on retail loans). Another respondent suggested that while CSRBB must be measured and steered, the specific design including integrated or isolated measurement should be up to the banks and suggests reflecting this aspect in the final text.

PARAGRAPH_88988: Some respondents suggest the possibility to perform materiality assessments to exclude positions which turn to be immaterial without the necessity of cumbersome verifications. Others suggest to introduce the possibility to exclude positions if the institution can demonstrate that the respective risk is already measured and manage elsewhere (e.g., in credit risk). Some respondents consider the approach to document and justify exclusions would be cumbersome and time-consuming. Respondents ask for a pragmatic approach and recommend enhancing the application of the principle of proportionality in this case. One respondent suggests EBA to identify classes of products that may be excluded from the CSRBB assessment. Some respondents consider the need to document and justify the exclusion of instruments would be in fact a requirement that would apply to a large part of instruments in the banking book. One respondent believes the current framework is too complex and challenging to implement for smaller institutions with non-complex operations and limited market risk exposure. Another respondent recommends allowing the introduction of a threshold to ensure that small banks, and more generally banks with immaterial risk exposures, can be excluded from the CSRBB calculation process. Some respondents suggest the EBA to clarify if, and how, a principle of proportionality could apply to banks for which the majority of instruments in their

PARAGRAPH_88989: Any diversification with other risk measures potentially affecting other processes (e.g., business and/or liquidity risk) are not part of the mandate. The EBA wishes to clarify the intention of excluding idiosyncratic spread, as suggested by the Basel Standards, is to avoid overlapping with the credit risk framework. Regarding proportionality, the EBA considers section 4.1.2 provides sufficient guidance and flexibility for institutions to apply proportional measures in the assessment and monitoring of CSRBB.
