PARAGRAPH_77193: 1. Executive summary

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_77194: The complexity of information and communication technology (ICT) and security risks is increasing and the frequency of ICT and security-related incidents (including cyber incidents) is rising, together with their potential significant adverse impact on financial institutions' operational functioning. Moreover, due to the interconnectedness of financial institutions, ICT and security-related incidents risk causing potential systemic impacts. The EBA has responded to this by detailing how supervisors should cover ICT and security risks within supervision (EBA/GL/2017/05), by detailing how financial institutions should manage outsourcing (EBA/GL/2019/02) and by describing the expectations for ICT and security risk management for the financial institutions in these guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_77195: These guidelines set out how financial institutions should manage the ICT and security risks that they are exposed to. In addition, this guidance aims to provide the financial institutions to which the guidelines apply with a better understanding of supervisory expectations for the management of ICT and security risks.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_77196: These guidelines integrate and are built on the requirements set out in the 'Guidelines on security measures for operational and security risks of payment services' (hereafter 'Guidelines on security measures'), which were published in December 2017 (EBA/GL/2017/17) and which have applied since January 2018 in fulfilment of the mandate in Article 95(3) of Directive 2015/2366/EU (PSD2). Those guidelines were addressed to payment service providers (PSPs), and only applied to their payment services; however, they were in fact relevant to a broader set of institutions. For that reason, these guidelines have been formulated to be addressed to a broader range of financial institutions under the EBA's remit (namely to credit institutions which already fell within the scope of the guidelines on security measures for their payment services, but for which these guidelines will now apply for all activities) and to investment firms. These guidelines continue to apply to PSPs for the payment services they provide; they extend to other activities of credit institutions and also apply to investment firms for all activities. Collectively, the guidelines apply to financial institutions as set out in paragraph 9 under the addressees section.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3] [RISK:OPERATIONAL_RISK] [RISK:LEGAL_RISK] [RISK:REPUTATIONAL_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_77197: The term 'ICT and security risks' addresses the operational and security risks mandate of Article 95 of the revised Payments Services Directive (PSD2). This term recognises that the operational risks for payment services refer predominantly to ICT and security risks because of the electronic nature of payment services (over ICT systems). For this reason, these guidelines refer to 'ICT and security risk' instead of 'operational and security risk' to avoid confusion with wider operational risk issues, such as conduct risk, legal risk and reputational risk. Furthermore, security risks may stem from inadequate or failed internal processes or external events, but ultimately it is their impact on systems and data that is relevant. The definition of 'ICT and security risk' is based on the definition in the EBA Guidelines on the revised common procedures and methodologies for the supervisory review and evaluation process and supervisory stress testing (EBA/GL/2018/03); thus, it encompasses data integrity risk but includes additional details to clarify that it covers the impact deriving from security risks.

PARAGRAPH_77203: (ii) Article 95 of Directive 2015/2366/EU (PSD2), which contains explicit provisions for the management of operation and security risks that require PSPs to have appropriate mitigation measures and control mechanisms to manage the operational and security risks and includes a mandate for the EBA to develop guidelines on this topic.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_77204: These guidelines specify the above-mentioned requirements as follows:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_77205: Section 3.1 sets out the proportionate application of these guidelines, recognising the potential variation in size, complexity, internal organisation, nature, scope and riskiness of the services and products between financial institutions.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_77206: Section 3.2 of the guidelines focuses on the management and mitigation of ICT and security risks through establishing sound internal governance and an internal control framework that sets clear responsibilities for financial institutions' staff, including for the management bodies. It requires the establishment of the financial institutions' ICT strategy, which should be aligned with their overall business strategy. The guidelines also remind financial institutions to ensure the effectiveness of the risk-mitigating measures, as defined by their risk management framework, when outsourcing or using third party providers. This should be set out in contracts and service level agreements. Nevertheless, financial institutions should monitor and seek assurance of the level of compliance.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_77207: Section 3.3 requires financial institutions to manage and mitigate ICT and security risks through an independent and objective control function, appropriately segregated from ICT operations processes and not responsible for any internal audit, and an independent internal audit function. It requires financial institutions to maintain updated mapping of their business functions, supporting processes and information assets and to classify them in terms of criticality, based on the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data. Based on this, financial institutions should assess the operational risks related to ICT and the security risks that impact them and should determine what measures are required to mitigate the identified risks.

PARAGRAPH_77214: Section 3.6 describes requirements for ICT project and change management, including the acquisition, development and maintenance of ICT systems and services. Financial institutions should ensure that changes to production systems are assessed, tested, approved and implemented in a controlled manner, with the aim of ensuring that ICT projects have appropriate governance and oversight and that the development of applications is carefully monitored from the test phase to the production phase.

PARAGRAPH_77215: Section 3.7 specifies expectations with regard to business continuity management and developing response and recovery plans, including testing, and their consequent updating based on the test results. Financial institutions should ensure that they have effective crisis communication measures in place so that all relevant internal and external stakeholders can be informed in a timely manner. The ICT business continuity management processes are an integral part of the overall financial institution's business continuity management process and should not be separated.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_77216: The last section, Section 3.8, applies only to PSPs for their provision of payment services. It prescribes requirements for payment service users (PSUs) relationship management, including allowing PSUs to disable specific payment functionalities (where product functionality permits), receiving alerts on initiated and/or failed attempts to initiate payment transactions, and providing PSUs with assistance on questions and requests for support. The EBA stresses the importance of ensuring transparency, such that PSUs are always aware of which PSP is responsible for providing them with the payment service.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_77217: In implementing these guidelines, financial institutions should refer to existing standards and leading best practices. These guidelines intend to be technology and methodology agnostic.

PARAGRAPH_77218: The implementation of these guidelines should be done in accordance with the principle of proportionality, taking into account the scale and complexity of operations, the nature of the activity engaged in, the types of services provided and the corresponding ICT and security risks related to financial institutions' processes and services.

PARAGRAPH_77219: These guidelines complement and should be read in conjunction with the supervisory assessment to the applicable institutions in the EBA Guidelines on ICT risk assessment under the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (EBA/GL/2017/05), which are addressed to supervisors, as well as other relevant guidelines such as the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements (EBA/GL/2019/02).

PARAGRAPH_77225: 2. Background and rationale

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_77226: 1. ICT risks can pose significant adverse prudential risks, potentially compromising a financial institution's viability. For this reason, ICT and security risk management is fundamental for a financial institution to achieve its strategic, corporate, operational and reputational objectives.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_77227: 2. The scope of application of the guidelines covers PSPs for their payment services (any reference to 'payment services' includes 'issuing of electronic money'), credit institutions for all activities beyond their payment services and also investment firms for all activities. Specifically, these guidelines are addressed to (1) PSPs as defined in Article 4(11) of PSD2; (2) to institutions, meaning credit institutions and investment firms as defined in point 3 of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; and (3) to competent authorities, as defined in point 40 of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, including the European Central Bank with regard to matters relating to the tasks conferred on it by Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013, and to competent authorities under PSD2, as referred to in point (i) of Article 4(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. For the purpose of these guidelines, unless specified otherwise, the addressees in points 1 and 2 above are collectively referred to as 'financial institutions'.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_77228: 3. These guidelines integrate the 'Guidelines on security measures for operational and security risks of payment services' under Article 95 of PSD2, which were published in December 2017 (EBA/GL/2017/17), and elaborate further on certain topics that contribute to mitigating ICT and security risks in financial institutions. These guidelines therefore contribute to a level playing field for all financial institutions. The guidelines also address the European Commission (the Commission) request set out in the Commission's financial technology (FinTech) action plan published in March 2018, which requests that European Supervisory Authorities develop guidelines on ICT risk management and mitigation requirements in the EU financial sector1.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_77229: 4. The guidelines address ICT and security risks that have increased in recent years. This is due to the increasing digitalisation of the financial sector and the increasing interconnectedness through telecommunications channels (internet, mobile and wireless lines, and wide area networks) and with other financial institutions and third parties. This renders financial institutions' operations vulnerable to external security attacks, including cyber-attacks; therefore, recognising the need for preparedness for cybersecurity, these guidelines implicitly cover the need for cybersecurity within the financial institution's information security measures. While these guidelines recognise that cybersecurity should be undertaken as part of a financial institution's overall information security risk management, it is worthwhile pointing out that

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_77234: cyber-attacks have some specific characteristics that should be taken into account in ensuring that the information security measures are adequate to mitigate cyber risks:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_77235: i) Unlike most other sources of risk, malicious cyber-attacks are often difficult to identify or fully eradicate, and the breadth of damage is difficult to determine.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_77236: ii) Some cyber-attacks can render common risk management and business continuity arrangements ineffective (e.g. disaster recovery procedures), and they might in some instances fuel the spread of malware and corrupted data to backup systems.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_77237: iii) Third party service providers, vendors and vendors' products may become channels to propagate cyber-attacks; therefore, an interconnected financial institution that has individual low relevance may become vulnerable and a source of risk propagation. Observing the weakest link principle, cybersecurity should not only be a concern for major market participants and critical service providers.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_77238: 5. The guidelines are compatible with the three lines of defence model, with the ICT operational units being the first line of defence. The guidelines focus in particular on the responsibilities of the management body and the second line of defence (which usually includes the information security function), and, following the public consultation, the structure of the guidelines has been revised to better reflect this focus. It is further clarified that cross-references to the EBA Guidelines on internal governance (EBA/GL/2017/11) are intended to incorporate in these guidelines governance requirements that are (objectively) valid for the purposes of these guidelines. For the avoidance of doubt, references do not change or expand the scope of application of the EBA Guidelines on internal governance.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_77239: 6. The provisions of the 'Guidelines on the security measures for operational and security risks of payment services' (EBA/GL/2017/17) have been transposed and incorporated into these guidelines, with a wording that has been adapted to fit with the wider scope of addressees and with other provisions. As it was the case for the 'Guidelines on the security measures for operational and security risks of payment services', these guidelines should be applied in a manner that is proportionate to the nature, scope and complexity of the PSPs' and institutions' businesses and the corresponding ICT and security risks. The 'Guidelines on the security measures for operational and security risks of payment services' (EBA/GL/2017/17) will therefore be repealed with effect from the date of application of these guidelines, which replace them in their entirety.

ICT systems and services also represent material proportions of institutions' costs, investments and intangible assets. Furthermore, technological innovation plays a crucial role in the banking sector from a strategic standpoint, as a source of competitive advantage, as it is a fundamental tool for competing in the financial market through new products as well as through facilitating the restructuring and optimisation of the value chain.

PARAGRAPH_77617: Option 1a would mean a new set of Guidelines on ICT and security management for credit institutions and investments firms for all activities and services. However, given that most of the requirements that apply to the security of payment services (i.e. those already within the published Guidelines on security measures) are also applicable for security of other services and activities, the two sets of guidelines would have significant overlap and would create confusion for credit institutions which already apply the Guidelines on security measures for their payment services. This then means that the benefits of having two different guidelines are limited.

However, this option risks requirements becoming obsolete very quickly due to the ever-changing nature of ICT and security risks.

PARAGRAPH_77642: One respondent expressed concerns relating to the impact of these guidelines on third party providers (TPPs), given the open banking facility in PSD2. Their concerns relate to how each competent authority will comply with these guidelines, as a possible restrictive interpretation could introduce barriers to entry, impact the number of TPPs and negatively affect the growth of open banking. Moreover, it was noted that the guidelines can be interpreted liberally or restrictively by competent authorities. This could result in new entrants requesting authorisation and licence from jurisdictions with a less restrictive interpretation of the guidelines for the provision of their cross-border services. Consequently, consumers may be exposed to different ICT security levels and risks. The need for a more legally binding text (i.e. a level 1 text) was also proposed by the same respondent. The respondent noted the possibility of the 'deceptive' implementation of the guidelines by institutions and therefore called for sanctions to enforce the implementation of the guidelines. This is to avoid a situation where, in a potential fraud case caused by a TPP, consumers may blame the banks for exposing them to loss of reputation and credibility, as the banks hold the client relationship. Sanctions could be a useful tool for supervisors to protect customers and financial services. They also suggested introducing and applying industry standards (such as an open

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:35]
PARAGRAPH_77653: A few comments were received on the guidelines being principle based versus being rules based. Some respondents supported and encouraged the EBA's use of the principle-based approach, commenting that this is essential and should be maintained as far as possible. Specifically the focus on outcomes that allow firms to demonstrate capabilities was cited as increasing consistency. This approach ensures that the guidelines can be implemented with proportionality in mind.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:35] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_77654: The EBA agrees with a principle- based approach, and the guidelines are drafted with this explicit intention. The EBA intends to ensure that the guidelines are principle based and flexible enough to facilitate their application to all the relevant institutions in the sector. Furthermore, it is important to ensure that the guidelines remain valid in the continuously evolving

overly prescriptive but to cover the main important areas of ICT and security risk management. In several parts the detailed points are drafted as examples to be considered. That said, a number of specific points have been amended based on the current supervisory insights for future developments in ICT and security risk management maturity.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:35]
PARAGRAPH_77657: Principle-based guidance also provides the flexibility required for the continuously evolving nature of technology risks and avoids prescriptive and detailed requirements that may become obsolete over time. This would increase consistency and alignment with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) guidance 'Cyber resilience for financial market infrastructures'. Where more detailed guidance is provided, the EBA should consider separating these out as examples or use cases, such as how the three lines of defence could be implemented to provide examples of how the requirements could apply or be interpreted. Other respondents considered that some requirements in the guidelines are too prescriptive and too detailed and are thereby limiting the risk management options available to financial institutions (such as governance structures, internal controls and other security-related measures). This was considered to put at risk the ability of the guidelines to withstand the rapid nature of changes in the ICT and information security risk landscape in the years to come. It might also ultimately limit

PARAGRAPH_77665: financial institutions' abilities to innovate within the information and cybersecurity domain. One respondent noted that a departure from the existing recognised standards increases regulatory complexity and requires resources to be diverted from other activities, inhibiting firms from focusing their efforts on the identification of and protection against technological risks, thus increasing the amount of firms' resources that are focusing on compliance rather than on technological security. This respondent recommended the international harmonisation of ICT rules in the EU and globally, as diverging regulatory requirements will significantly increase operating costs and will introduce risks of regulatory arbitrage.

PARAGRAPH_77673: One respondent commented that the guidelines seem to separate the 'business' and 'IT' functions within an organisation, thus not taking into account new configurations, represented particularly by FinTech start- ups. It was further commented that new developments in ICT seem to be ignored, such as cloud computing and distributed ledger technology (DLT), along with the issues of end-to-end data encryption in the course of data processing; access to data, which conflicts with banking confidentiality (General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR), management of ICT security in the form of internal outsourcing, etc. The same respondent understood that the objective of these guidelines was to integrate and standardise all ICT guidelines (in force and under implementation), taking into account relevant national guidelines.

PARAGRAPH_77674: The guidelines cover ICT from a holistic business point of view, using the overall business strategy and business processes as a starting point. If new entrants are primarily technology driven, business strategy and ICT strategy will coincide, but this does not change the expectations on formulating and approving such strategies. The guidelines are technology agnostic. It is up to an institution to ensure that appropriate security measures are implemented, e.g. by using new technologies or by leveraging more traditional technologies. The EBA cannot specify all details or all technologies.

PARAGRAPH_77685: Some respondents proposed that the guidelines are linked - where relevant - to European and international practices/requirements/standards/regulations relating to ICT risk management that are already in place. Examples include (1) the Financial Stability Board (FSB) Cyber Lexicon, (2) the Basel Committee's 'Principles for the sound management of operational risk', (3) the FSB's 'Guidance on arrangements to support operational continuity in resolution, (4) the EBA's 'Guidelines on outsourcing', (5) the ECB's 'Cyber resilience oversight expectations for financial market infrastructures', and (6) International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001/2 for controls and ISO 27005 for risk management. Without an explicit reference or a gap analysis, it is currently not clear how the guidelines overlap or complement the existing standards in place. In addition, overly general guidelines are open to interpretation both by organisations and by supervisors in each Member State, and references to existing standards will ease harmonisation across Member States and provide assistance in the consistent interpretation of requirements. One respondent commented that the guidelines do not mention any international standard and appear to be a stand-alone best practice for the whole sector. However, much of the guidelines work should be (or should already have been) taken from international standards (e.g. ISO)

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:37] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_77686: The aim of EBA was to ensure that these guidelines are technology and methodology agnostic and do not prescribe any particular international standards or stand-alone good practices. It would not be feasible for the EBA to mention all the existing standards and regulations in the text of the guidelines. However, in the executive summary, the EBA highlights the two main regulations (PSD2 and CRD IV) as these guidelines elaborate how to comply with their requirements. Furthermore, the executive summary has been amended with references to the existing EBA guidelines. The ECB cyber resilience oversight expectations for financial market infrastructures are aligned with these guidelines, but the main difference is in their scope, as the ECB cyber resilience oversight expectations specify details for financial market infrastructures, while these guidelines apply to institutions.

A request was made to reference the existing guidelines in these new guidelines.

PARAGRAPH_77699: The EBA has amended the executive summary with references to existing EBA guidelines that are relevant to these guidelines. The Guidelines on ICT risk assessment under the supervisory review and evaluation process (EBA/GL/2017/05) are addressed to competent authorities, while these guidelines are addressed to financial institutions. For these guidelines to add value it was agreed not to do a direct mapping of the requirements but to word them in a way that makes it easier for the financial institutions to read over and apply them. These guidelines are directed at financial institutions and cover ICT and security risk management from a holistic perspective. In particular, the definition of ICT and security risk details that this covers data confidentiality, integrity and availability. This is also found in other definitions, such as of incidents, and is included in processes such as the classification and risk assessment process. The aspect of data integrity, therefore, is fully integrated into the entire guideline, instead of being dealt with as a specific risk type. In contrast, the EBA/GL/2017/05 guidelines are directed at supervisors. Since the supervisory

PARAGRAPH_77732: A question was received on the addressees about why these guidelines (EBA/CP/2018/15) are addressed to institutions related to PSD2, while the Guidelines on ICT risk assessment under the supervisory review and evaluation process (EBA/GL/2017/05) have a broader scope. If an entity is not related to PSD2, will the EBA/GL/2017/05 guidelines continue to apply? If an entity is related to PSD2, are both guidelines going to apply, or only this last one (EBA/CP/2018/15)?

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:40] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_77733: The addressees of the EBA guideline - the subject of the consultation (EBA/CP/2018/15) - are not only the institutions related to PSD2, but a broader range of institutions under the EBA remit (e.g. investment firms and other activities of the credit institutions). These guidelines do not repeal the Guidelines on ICT risk assessment under the supervisory review and evaluation process (EBA/GL/2017/05), so they both should be applied according to their scope/addressees. Note that EBA/GL/2017/05 is intended for supervisors, not financial institutions. The EBA expects that if financial institutions implement the Guidelines on ICT and security risk management, providing supervisors with the input required for EBA/GL/2017/05 should not lead to undue burdens.

As specified in the scope of these guidelines (paragraph 7), for the purposes of these guidelines, the term ICT and security risk addresses the operational and security risks of Article 95 of PSD2 (including cyber risk).

A further comment was received that the current wording describes a risk and not an operational or security incident.

PARAGRAPH_77772: Risk tolerance - some respondents suggested using 'risk appetite', which is more common. The use of 'risk appetite' would also be consistent with other EBA guidelines (e.g. SREP, internal governance). Furthermore, one respondent explained that risk tolerance is understood as the variability regarding the established risk appetite that the organisation can accept under some circumstances. They commented that risk appetite can consider the aggregate level of risk as a medium value of the addition of risks in the organisation, and not only their addition. One suggestion to overcome this was to add this term into the text (hence, risk tolerance or risk appetite). Another respondent commented that, in relation to paragraph 13a), 'risk tolerance' is a term used in connection with the investments, whereas the whole document is about ICT-related risks, so they suggested providing more details relating to ICT in the definition.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:42]
PARAGRAPH_77773: The EBA agrees to change the definition to 'risk appetite', to coincide with the use of this in the EBA Guidelines on internal governance (EBA/GL/2017/11), the Guidelines on the revised common procedures and methodologies for the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) and supervisory stress testing (EBA/GL/2014/13) and the Guidelines on security measures for operational and security risks (EBA/GL/2017/17).

PARAGRAPH_77777: ICT projects - comments suggested that the definition should refer to ICT projects' 'end of life' or 'removal' as part of wider ICT and business transformation programmes, while a suggestion was received to add the word 'dismissed' to refer to this same notion, as the removal of ICT systems should be treated with the same caution as that given to their change, replacement or implementation. Another respondent commented that the definition is too wide and suggested shortening it to 'Any project where ICT systems and services are changed, replaced or implemented. ICT projects can be part of wider ICT or business transformation programmes.'

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:42]
PARAGRAPH_77778: The EBA considers that shortening the definition would adversely impact the intention of the definition; however, it is reasonable to add the phrase 'dismissed' to the definition. Adding this completes the definition.

PARAGRAPH_77790: the following definition: 'A collection of information, either tangible or intangible, that is supports the critical business functions and processes in the business environment, and that the entity deems te be characterises as worth protecting following a risk assessment.' A further comment was received in which it was suggested that the wording 'that is worth protecting' should be the outcome of the risk analysis, as an information asset may be significantly relevant for the functioning of the organisation but not worth protecting due to the cost of implementing security measures (tangible or intangible costs). Another respondent suggested changing the definition to 'information, data and tools required for the processing thereof, which can either belong to the company or be stored under bailment (e.g. personal data).' The respondent considers that mentioning 'tools' is significant, as all measures taken on the protection of information are tightly related to the tools (e.g. user rights), while leaving the definition only as 'pure data' makes things philosophical and removes the connection to reality, where data does not exist by itself but is always under the management of some tools. Another respondent suggested harmonising this definition with the wording in paragraph 17.

PARAGRAPH_77847: One respondent asked that additional wording be added in order to be clear on the obligation of all addressees to comply with the new guidelines. This new wording should set out that proportionality cannot be understood as grounds for exemption and that all addressees should address and manage their ICT and security risks.

PARAGRAPH_77850: One respondent commented that, although appropriate, the principle of proportionality may lead to financial institutions excluding the implementation of security controls, based solely on cost factors. The principle of proportionality must be closely monitored by the management bodies (or even the regulator) that will issue the relevant guidelines. Hence, the respondent suggested considering the amendment of Section 4.1 and its association with Section 4.2.1. Another respondent suggested including a more comprehensive set of principles governing the proportionate application, or a differentiation between minimum requirements and those that could be applied proportionately, in order for institutions to achieve compliance with competent authorities' needs.

PARAGRAPH_77859: Another suggested that 'proportionality' is better expressed as 'a graded approach' according to the specific context, objectives, conditions and needs of financial institutions. The respondent suggested that it is appropriate to set minimum criteria (factors) to be taken into account and proposed the following for paragraph 4.1: 'The management body should apply the graded approach to comply with the provisions set out in these guidelines in such a way that is proportionate to, and takes account of, at least the following factors: a) security significance of the financial institution and its parts, b) the financial institution's size and complexity, c) internal organisation, d) the nature, scope, complexity and riskiness of the services and products that the financial institutions provide or intend to provide, e) the strategy and the goals. The factors used to grade the development and application of the guidelines shall be documented.' Another respondent commented that adapting to the requirements in the guidelines could be a significant problem for organisations operating on a small scale, such as cooperative banks, payment services institutions and FinTech start-ups. The application of the principle of proportionality should be clarified to specify which aspects are important for these organisations and which are not. This applies particularly to countries where 'gold-plating' occurs. This can lead to other negative outcomes, such as the migration of payment institutions to more 'liberal' countries.

PARAGRAPH_77860: These are principle-based guidelines that, as explained in paragraph 1 of the guidelines (see Section 3.1), should be applied by all institutions in a proportionate manner. The application of these guidelines is not for competent authorities' needs but for institutions to ensure that they manage their ICT and security risks proportionately. Furthermore using a graded approach would limit the implementation of principle-based guidelines and it is the right of the management body to establish proportionate application. These guidelines will be applied for more services and by more addressees than the Guidelines on security measures for operational and security risk under PSD2 (EBA/GL/2017/17). It is important that the guidelines are 'size neutral' and are applicable to all addressees. All institutions must apply all the guidelines in a proportionate manner based on paragraph 1 (see Section 3.1).

PARAGRAPH_77872: responsibilities should be amended in the guidelines (in paragraph 4) to permit delegation where appropriate, e.g. in implementing processes. The need for the management body to approve specific risk-type policies should also be reconsidered. One respondent elaborated concerns that the drafting would significantly expand the management body's obligations to include the day-to-day activities regarding the design and implementation of ICT governance and strategy. This level of granularity is not considered necessary, given that the management body discharges its obligation to ensure that an adequate control framework is in place, as detailed in paragraph 2. Another respondent proposed replacing 'management body' with 'senior management body', making reference to governance and mentioning the activity of 'ensuring'. The respondent suggested promoting a view of ICT corporate governance and, by definition, that the responsibility of governance belongs to the Executive Board while the responsibility of management belongs to the management body. Another respondent suggested that the management body should have at least one expert in the information security/ICT risks field in order to properly execute governance.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:47]
PARAGRAPH_77873: Paragraph 4 states that the oversight of implementation is for the management body, which is in line with paragraph 23 of the EBA Guidelines on internal governance (EBA/GL/2017/11). In addition, the EBA does not state that the management body should formulate and draft the policies but considers that the general ICT and security risk management framework and information security framework is of such particular importance that it should be approved periodically at the highest level. The term management body is used in line with the EBA Guidelines on internal governance (EBA/GL/2017/11). The guidelines do not prescribe the composition (or part of it) of the management body. The EBA does not see a need to promote and define the ICT corporate governance into the management body. The guidelines allow for implementation by all institutions (according to their size or mandate).

PARAGRAPH_77884: One respondent suggested deleting the requirement for a sustainable budget for setting an adequate internal governance and control framework (paragraph 3). The respondent fully supported supervisors' expectations to ensure an appropriate budget for an institution to meet its requirements on ICT governance and also agreed on having an overall sustainable budget, which is, in their understanding, to maintain the ability for an institution to (1) meet its current as well as expected future financial obligations and (2) sustain growth, both primarily through current or past income. Nevertheless, the respondent questioned the requirement for having a sustainable budget for such a limited scope as ICT governance, particularly as the support of operational needs and the implementation of risk management processes is associated with costs and not directly related to income.

PARAGRAPH_77888: The concept of 'key roles' in paragraph 3 is considered vague by some respondents, as it relates to training, and all staff should receive information security training. One respondent commented that the wording contradicts the principle in paragraph 30 of chapter 4.4.1, where it states that the information security policy should apply to all employees, and in paragraph 52 of chapter 4.4.8, where training applies to all employees. Others wanted to receive more detail about what are considered 'staff members occupying key roles'. One respondent suggested clarifying that the requirement for quantity and skills of staff specifies that it is for relevant staff, as, in banks, only part of the staff is responsible for performing the tasks listed. Heightening the awareness of all staff is already addressed in, for example, paragraph 54. The new wording suggested is ' ... the quantity and skills of financial institutions' relevant staff is adequate ... '

PARAGRAPH_77889: The EBA agrees with the need for information security training for all staff members and in particular for key function holders in the institution. The guidelines have been updated to state that training is necessary for all staff including key function holders. Key function holder has a meaning as set out in the EBA Guidelines on internal governance (EBA/GL/2017/11). Furthermore, financial institutions should ensure that on an annual basis, or more frequently if required, all staff members including key function holders receive appropriate training on ICT and security risks, including on information security.

PARAGRAPH_77960: One respondent asked for consistency in requirements across the sectors because 'intragroup' would include insurance companies, and in the event that a financial institution's ICT serves multiple subsidiaries, it would be complex to have different security controls on different subsidiaries.

PARAGRAPH_77961: To create the necessary requirements for other sectors, is the responsibility of the other European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs). Therefore, it is not possible for the EBA to define cross-sectoral requirements that must be applied in all of the sectors. However the ESAs liaise closely on this topic in order to be aligned in their approaches.

PARAGRAPH_77964: A question was received asking if the measures set out in these guidelines should be included in the outsourcing risk assessments whenever the outsourced service is related to payment services. One respondent proposed the following changes to clarify that the provision of services by third parties should not trigger the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements: '[ ... ] including the measures set out in these guidelines, when important operational functions of payment services and/or ICT services and ICT systems are outsourced, including to group entities, or when using third parties'. With regard to the wording 'financial institutions should ensure the effectiveness of the risk-mitigating measures as defined by their risk management framework', one respondent suggested that the risk management framework of each institution could be enhanced through a common risk management framework, such as the one already established by the ECB - i.e. risk assessment questions of the ECB for outsourcing providers. This common framework will help to ensure consistency among all institutions. There was a request to clarify that group entities are covered only to the extent applicable in line with current vendor risk obligations and

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:52] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_77965: The EBA considers that the measures in these guidelines should be included in the outsourcing risk assessments, as these general principles need to be applied when outsourcing. The scope of the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements is clearly specified in those guidelines. The intention of this section is to ensure that ICT and security risks are covered not only when outsourcing but also when using third parties. The EBA does not support the suggested modification in the wording. The option of using third parties is an important issue, and it is important to keep it in this point. The intention is not to specify one risk management framework over another. The guidelines are principle based.

PARAGRAPH_77978: Requests for clarification were received for the specific use of the wording 'critical or important' in both paragraphs 7 and 8, to align with the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements (EBA/GL/2019/02), i.e. 'when critical or important operational functions ... '. In particular, one respondent suggested limiting paragraph 8 to (critical or important) outsourcing of ICT services and ICT systems, as otherwise the principle of proportionality and the draft guidelines' objective to focus on risk might be contradicted. This is because they consider that the minimum contractual content outlined in paragraph 8 is too extensive for the entirety of the potential ICT-related services or systems procured from third parties. Rather, the assessment of the necessity for specific contractual requirements should be within the responsibility of the institution, whereas, in line with the principle of proportionality, necessity should be risk based.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:53]
PARAGRAPH_77979: The suggested wording (to add 'critical or important' operational functions) is not necessary, as the guidelines apply for any outsourced service or system, and it is the company's right to determine whether it is critical or important, based on its proportionality. The guidelines are risk based and proportionality is already specified in the guidelines. Furthermore the Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements set out the guidance for critical and important outsourcing.

PARAGRAPH_78001: One respondent suggested that the use of KPIs to monitor compliance of the outsourcing provider to the SLA provisions, as well as key risk indicators (KRIs) for outsourcing provider evaluation purposes could benefit financial institutions. Generic KPIs and KRIs could be provided to ensure consistency among financial institutions, at least to a certain degree, since other laws and regulations may impose diverse requirements. Such generic KRIs could include certifications of the outsourcing provider against ISO 27001:2013, the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Cloud Control Matrix (CCM) and/or STAR certification (for cloud providers).

Monitoring and potential assurance of compliance should be appropriate to the service or system's relevance and the risk it poses, whereas the assessment of associated risks is conducted by means of various mandatory risk assessments, e.g. outsourcing risk assessments, vendor risk assessments and information security risk assessments.

PARAGRAPH_78054: Comments were received on the specification in the text of the three lines of defence (3LoD) model, with a request that the model for implementation should not be specified, particularly as this is considered to move away from the guidelines being 'principle based'. The focus should be on ensuring an effective internal risk management and control model. This would be, for example, just a clear description of what duties and responsibilities reside with the respective lines of defence, on an overall level. This description should be in line with EBA/GL/2017/11 Guidelines on internal governance under Directive 2013/36/EU. One respondent also highlighted that there is no consistent industry standard for the 3LoD model, whereby the model is implemented by institutions in accordance with their size, structure and complexity. This has resulted in the allocation of information security roles to the first or second line of defence not being consistent in industry. The view was also that the objectives of the guidelines are met without the need to disrupt the existing enterprise risk management practices. One respondent said that banks should not be forced to manage ICT risks differently from the rest of their risks. Others said that this guidance may be deemed useful for smaller, less mature institutions but not for well-established institutions that already meet existing

One respondent proposed changes in paragraph 11: ' ... in charge of ICT systems, processes and security operations, which could be acting as the first line of defence, should operate under the supervision of an internal control function, which could be acting as a second line of defence. This internal control function should take responsibility for the management of ICT risks. The internal audit function, which could be acting as the third line of defence should have the capacity to independently review and provide assurance of the respective roles the above-mentioned functions (see Section 4.3.6)

In addition, the respondent suggested adjusting the wording for the three lines of defence in paragraphs 11, 13, 27, 32 and 33, as the three lines of defence are not described clearly and consistently.

PARAGRAPH_78078: One respondent commented that the distinction in the requirements between financial institutions and PSPs is incomprehensible. PSPs should also follow the 3LoD model and an appropriate internal control function. Another respondent requested clarification of paragraph 11, as in paragraph 10 the use of the 3LoD model is a mandatory requirement, while paragraph 11 seems to leave it optional to manage the ICT risks under this model, using the term 'where the three lines of defence is applied'. However, the respondent requested wording that suggests that the 3LoD model is used but, for reasons of proportionality in small financial institutions, risk management can be done as effectively as necessary under a different approach. It should be more important to create a robust ICT risk management with an independent internal control function than to formally stick to a model. This approach would be especially valuable in situations where, due to head count, the implementation of all three lines of defence would prove to be difficult.

PARAGRAPH_78082: One respondent suggested changing the wording in paragraph 11 to 'internal control function should take responsibility of the control of ICT risks'. Currently, according to paragraph 11, an internal control function in the second line of defence should 'take responsibility for the management of ICT risks', but this was considered unclear. The suggestion is to ensure that it is the same as the requirements defined in EBA/GL/2017/11 Guidelines on internal governance under Directive 2013/36/EU, paragraphs 174 to 180 on the risk management function's role in identifying, measuring, assessing, managing, mitigating, monitoring and reporting on risks. Another respondent suggested that where it is mentioned that the second line of defence should take 'responsibility' for the management of ICT risks, this should be replaced with 'accountability', since the responsibility of managing ICT risks during the daily tasks is the first line

Another respondent commented that the internal control function should be in the information security and operational risk management departments, as it is not clear how one single department can manage ICT risks alone. Another respondent commented that the internal control function should be allowed to be organisationally situated outside the ICT department in order to ensure independence and to avoid conflicts of interests. Another respondent suggested moving this paragraph to an annex as an example of a potential model framework for certain institutions with less mature risk management functions. Some rewording was suggested here for this purpose: ' ... acting as the first line of defence, should operate under the supervision oversight of an internal control function acting as a second line of defence.

PARAGRAPH_78117: A question was received about what details/criteria are required to determine the risk tolerance to ICT risks. One respondent also suggested providing a list of common risks that should be considered in risk assessment/risk mitigation processes, for instance the unavailability of key staff of financial institutions; the unavailability of data centre facilities (fire, power outage, power from city grid unavailable for 4, 8 or 24 hours); cyber-attack (distributed denial-of-service (DdoS), ransomware); and data leakage (inside job, external attack). (Some of the risks are listed in paragraph 39 in Section 3.2.1, review of the institutions' ICT risk profile in EBA/GL/2017/05). Another respondent suggested switching paragraphs 13(a) and 13(b) to first identify and assess, and then determine, risk tolerance. Another respondent suggested considering rephrasing paragraph 13(a) as follows: 'a) enable the management to determine an appropriate risk tolerance for ICT risks, [ ... ]'. The respondent stated that paragraph 13 provided a non-exhaustive list of processes to be implemented as part of the ICT risk management framework, including processes for determining the risk tolerance for ICT risk. The respondent noted that the institution's risk management framework contains processes to determine the institution's risk-bearing capacity, based on which the institution's management has to decide on its risk tolerance.

PARAGRAPH_78207: One respondent suggested that the mapping is done every 3 years. The mapping requirements in the EBA's current drafting seem to indicate that it would be expected of firms to complete a mapping of all functions, across all jurisdictions and legal entities. The respondent therefore also recommends that the EBA clarifies the scope and expectation of firms, to ensure that this is realistically completed, in line with business criticality and firms' risk appetites. With regard to third parties, it is not clear to the respondent if the requirements are in addition to the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements, in particular relating to inter-group arrangements or fourth parties.

PARAGRAPH_78249: One respondent was of the opinion that carrying out risk assessments, i.e. classification in terms of criticality, on supporting processes and information assets is generally inappropriate and in particular is too prescriptive. Consequently, the respondent asked that the guidelines limit the applicability of paragraph 21, in particular in the case of the classification of supporting processes and information assets and also for business functions where risk assessments of the aforementioned subjects should be reviewed using a risk-based approach. In line with this, major changes as listed in the second sentence in paragraph 21 or changes in the underlying ICT risks and related ICT systems should trigger a reassessment of risks. One respondent requested that 'business function' is defined. It also suggested that this point should be less restrictive so that different risk management methodologies can be implemented depending on the

PARAGRAPH_78250: See also the comment on paragraph 18. The criticality assessment is done by the financial institution and needs to include the supporting processes and information assets. The work needs to be done extensively for each process. However, if the risk assessment of a particular process shows that the process is not vital/critical, then the supporting information assets can be evaluated in a risk-based process as well. A more extensive risk assessment needs to be done for more important information assets.

PARAGRAPH_78259: characteristics of the organisation. For a very complex and big organisation, determining the ICT risks to every business function or information asset could be difficult to maintain and is not practical. Two respondents asked for the requirement for updates to be more frequent than 1 year to be deleted, i.e. 'This risk assessment should be carried out and documented, annually or at shorter intervals if required". The view was that assessments of ICT risks once a year are sufficient, since a new assessment takes place anyway during the course of the year if there are major changes. Further assessments during the year are not appropriate. Another respondent asked for clarification of or confirmation that this paragraph covers a risk-based approach, referring to 'annually or at shorter intervals, if required'.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:70] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_78304: One respondent suggested that quantitative requirements concerning the minimum and maximum audit frequency should be imposed, provided that the bracket is sufficiently wide (for example, from once a year to once every 3 years), in order to accommodate the specific nature of the operations of any given organisation. One respondent requested clarification of whether the requirement that 'The auditors should be independent within or from the institution' excludes the internal audit function. The respondent commented that internal audit is considered as being independent in financial institutions (by any applicable corporate governance model) and should be part of the audit. An external auditor will provide an unbiased opinion; nevertheless, this must also be part of the internal audit responsibilities. One respondent considered that the methodology should be periodically updated, to guarantee that it covers requirements related to new trends and changes in the payment ecosystem (cloud platforms, big data, new technologies, new actors in the payment ecosystem, etc.). Therefore, the respondent proposed adding the following sentence: 'The methodology should be periodically updated, to guarantee it considers requirements related to new trends and changes in the payment ecosystem'. One respondent asked for the final sentence ('The frequency and focus of such audits should be commensurate with the relevant ICT risks.) to be replaced by: 'The scope and frequency of the audits should be based on a risk assessment that takes into account the ICT assets supporting the critical business processes, the identified ICT risks, and the prior outcome of ICT and security audits or management reviews.'

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:70]
PARAGRAPH_78305: The frequency of such audits is not specified and depends on the financial institution (see paragraph 26). The requirement is based upon the internal audit requirements of the relevant regulations and is deemed sufficient. The requirement is based upon the internal audit requirements of the relevant regulations. Therefore, an amendment is not deemed necessary. Due to the principle-based approach of the guidelines, a rewording of the last sentence does not seem necessary. It would actually be limiting, since it focuses only on the critical business processes, whereas the audit universe should be more holistic.

PARAGRAPH_78323: One respondent commented that it is unclear on what level in the organisation the information security policy should be ratified. This should be clarified in the requirement. Some respondents said that the wording 'and based on the relevant results of the risk assessment process' should be deleted, since the information security policy establishes the information security objectives and the security framework of the financial institution. These objectives will determine the risk tolerance and how to manage the results of the risk assessment. However, the information security policy is not based on the relevant results of the risk assessment process, as stated in these guidelines. One respondent considered that the wording in paragraph 29 should be changed by adding at the end: 'It shall take into account regulatory and legal requirements for financial institutions and other legal provisions that affect ICT in general.' Another respondent suggested removing this paragraph, as this is already covered by Article 5 of Directive 2015/2366 (PSD2), which prescribes the conditions to obtain a licence. One of which is the development of an information and security policy. It further noted that the responsibility for fraud scenarios lies with fraud operations.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:73] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_78362: Further to the comments on Section 4.3.1 (paragraph 11), a number of comments were received on the three lines of defence referenced here and called for less prescription in the text, citing examples where the current wording would not be appropriate. Respondents suggested that the idea of clearly segregated lines of defence should remain but without assigning specific roles to each one of them. Specifically the guidelines could include a clear description (in line with EBA/GL/2017/11 Guidelines on internal governance) of what duties and responsibilities reside with the respective lines of defence, on an overall level. Some examples were given by respondents to illustrate their concerns: there are cases where an information security function/unit also includes security operations that are independent from the rest of ICT operations (e.g. firewall administration vs network administration). This segregation ensures that information security is fully independent (in terms of governance, organisation and technology) and cooperates very closely with ICT, but, as an operating model, it effectively creates an overlap between the first and second lines as regards the information security role in this context. In addition, it would be more efficient to only list the requirements regarding the security and risk management control objectives. Paragraph 32 refers to the information security function also as a function of the second line of defence and also mentions that this function is responsible for the security policy and for monitoring its implementation and reporting to the management independently. This would imply that the CISO function would be part of the second line of defence. It is not clear how this is related to the internal control function described in paragraphs 10 and 11. A revised wording for paragraph 32 was put forward: 'Financial institutions should establish an information security function, with the responsibilitiesy for it assigned to a designated person. Financial institutions should ensure the independence and objectivity of the information security function by appropriately segregating it from ICT operations processes (where

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:73] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_78363: Based on the feedback received, the guidelines have been amended to follow a 'principle-based' approach by removing paragraphs 32 and 33, and revising paragraphs 10 and 11. The revised guidelines do not prescribe to financial institutions how to implement the 3LoD model for ICT and security risk management purposes. The EBA considers that these guidelines are now compatible with the 3LoD model, with the ICT operational units being the first line of defence. The guidelines now focus in particular on the responsibilities of the management body and the second line of defence (which usually includes the information security function) and, following the public consultation, the structure of the guidelines has been revised to better reflect this focus. The cross-references to the EBA Guidelines on internal governance (EBA/GL/2017/11) added to paragraphs 10 and 11 are intended to incorporate in these guidelines governance requirements that are (objectively) valid for the purposes of these guidelines. The guidelines have been revised and now do not assign specific roles to each of the three lines of defence but describe the responsibilities of each. Furthermore, the revised guidelines do not explicitly require the establishment of an information security function, with the responsibilities assigned to a designated person, but a reference to the information security function is made in the background section. Based on the feedback received, paragraphs 32 and 33 have been removed. Paragraphs 10 and 11 have been

PARAGRAPH_78372: the three lines of defence model is applied, this function should be the second line of defence function see Section 4.3.1).' The first change reflects the fact that the accountability of the security function can be assigned to a single person but not all the responsibilities under the security function (some require a role/team). The second change is because it is considered to be too prescriptive to impose a specific operational or organisational model, given that these may vary significantly across financial institutions. The respondents then proposed that if the phrase 'where the three lines of defence model is applied, this function should be the second line of defence function - see Section 4.3.1' is not deleted, clarification should be made of the new role of the information security function in relation to the other second level of defence roles.

The respondent commented that the information security function, in the best case, could be part of the second line of defence but is not the only component of the second line of defence.

For instance, awareness and training, risk monitoring controls and reporting are first-line tasks. The second line can complement these through independent monitoring, control and assurance reviews, but it should not diffuse the responsibility of the first line in these areas. Another way to put this is that the second line of defence should perform its required activities also in the risk area of ICT and security risk.

It should be clarified that, with the appointment of an information security officer, the information security function is established. According to proportionality it may be necessary for the information security officer to have a team, but this should be a question of size and the level of risk exposure of the individual financial institution.

In paragraph 34(d) there is a reference to retention requirements set out in EU and national law with regard to the period of time for retaining access logs.

PARAGRAPH_78432: Paragraph 34(e): one respondent asked for clarification of the definition of 'information asset owner'. Depending on circumstances, an 'information asset owner' could be a person, a tool or a system. The question was raised whether any of these definitions can be accepted. In addition, the respondent asked if the definition in the guidelines was consistent with the definition used in the GDPR. In order to make it easier to understand and create relationships and controls at scale, the respondent suggested using the standardised terminology across legislation (e.g. the GDPR and PSD2). 34 (e) One respondent suggested additional the wording: 'Access management: access rights should be granted, removed or modified in a timely manner, according to predefined approval workflows involving either the applicant's immediate leader (subject-based approach) and/or the business owner of the information being accessed (information asset owner in an object-based approach).'

PARAGRAPH_78433: The comment has been accommodated. The EBA would like to clarify that these guidelines specify requirements for financial institutions, based on the CRD and PSD2.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:78] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_78445: Paragraph 34(g): mandatory two-factor authentication to access critical systems is too burdensome and it was suggested to remove it. The respondent agreed that it is more secure, but argued that it should not be mandatory if an adequate privileged access management process is implemented, e.g. New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) 23 and New York Codes, Rules and Regulations (NYCRR) 500: 'Based on its risk assessment, each covered entity shall use effective controls, which may include multifactor authentication'. It also questioned whether the two controls for network access are needed for the server and especially with a check against policy. A question was raised about whether the server will lose network connectivity if it is not compliant any more. The respondent suggested that this control should only be applicable for systems in non-secured areas, e.g. clients.

PARAGRAPH_78446: Another respondent commented that the provision for password complexity is vague, which could lead to multiple interpretations and therefore that this should be clearer in the text.

'Stronger authentication methods' are not to be confused with 'strong customer authentication (SCA) under PSD2' to be applied by PSPs when carrying out remote electronic transactions. SCA is defined as 'authentication based on the use of two or more elements categorised as knowledge (something only the user knows), possession (something only the user possesses) and inherence (something the user is) that are independent, in that the breach of one does not compromise the reliability of the others, and is designed in such a way as to protect the confidentiality of the authentication data.'

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:79]
PARAGRAPH_78463: One respondent appreciated that the requirements on logical security, physical security and ICT operational security follow the content of generally accepted standards such as ISO 27001/02 or the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework, as this contributes to harmonising applicable requirements. However, the respondent commented that the draft guidelines deviate from the structure of the aforementioned standards and therefore recommended further alignment to the standards mentioned and structuring them according to security domains or functions to enhance readability.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:80]
PARAGRAPH_78492: The EBA does not consider the list as examples but as necessary measures. Due to the interconnectedness of all ICT systems and ICT services, there is a need to observe all security issues.

Suggested wording: 'a) evaluate and remediate vulnerabilities by ensuring software and firmware are up to date, including the software provided by financial institutions to its internal and external users, by deploying critical security patches or by implementing compensating controls'. Their view was that currently the wording in paragraph 39(a) on the desired outcome to 'identify potential vulnerabilities' that starts this section is

PARAGRAPH_78508: From a network security perspective, one respondent said that it might be counterproductive to only require security baselines for certain 'critical network components'. Instead, there should be a framework in place that defines the level or type of security baseline for any given network device, in a risk-based manner. Suggested wording: 'b) secure configuration baselines of all network components such as core routers or switches should be implemented in a risk-based manner;' Another respondent considered that secure configuration baselines should be established not only for critical network components, but also for system components (servers, databases, etc.). Therefore, they proposed adding the following reference: 'Secure configuration baselines of critical network components [ ... ] and system components, such as servers and databases'.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:81]

PARAGRAPH_78556: One respondent proposed additional wording regarding a risk-based approach, as it is not possible to encrypt all data at rest and in transit: 'encryption of data at rest and in transit. The choice of cryptographic controls should be based on the security objectives (confidentiality, integrity/authenticity, authentication, non-repudiation) and be a result of a risk-based approach.'

PARAGRAPH_78560: Others asked for details on which level of encryption will be necessary. In transit, is every file, or only the channel (i.e.(TLS) necessary? At rest, is every file necessary? Another respondent suggested clarifying that the requirement should only be on critical or sensitive data, as not all the data needs to be encrypted, i.e. 'encryption of critical or sensitive data at rest and in transit.' (i.e. either use critical or sensitive). One respondent highlighted the importance of applying non-obsolete encryption methods and sufficient key length. New wording suggested: 'only non-obsolete encryption methods and sufficient key length should be used for encrypting data at rest and in transit.'

PARAGRAPH_78583: One respondent recommended that the requirement to 'constantly monitor security threats' should be rephrased to state that 'financial institutions establish a threat intelligence gathering and assessment process to identify, triage and counter targeted threats, and that this is embedded into its log correlation and orchestration processes'. Firms should know what they are monitoring for. This was reiterated by a comment on the intention of the wording 'actively monitoring technological developments' and how this should be understood. Another respondent suggested deleting the following wording ' .. their ability to provide services. Financial institutions should actively monitor technological developments to ensure that they are aware of security risks.', as it was deemed unclear how an institution can do this. Another respondent commented that there seems to be no consideration of proactive measures in this paragraph, e.g. threat hunting. One respondent suggested wording to clarify that proportionality aspects should be taken into account: 'Financial institutions should implement detective measures, for instance to identify possible information leakages, malicious code and other security threats, and publicly known vulnerabilities of software and hardware, and to check for corresponding new security updates.'

PARAGRAPH_78584: The EBA considers that there is no need for rephrasing, referring to the principle-based wording. The EBA considers that a financial institution should have the necessary capabilities to actively monitor technological developments and should be aware of the associated security risks.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:85] [RISK:OPERATIONAL_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_78598: A general comment on Section 4.4.7 was received for the guidelines to consider activities carried out by firms to assess and mitigate operational and ICT risks (e.g. operational risk self-assessment) that could align with the requirements in these guidelines. Another general comment was on the fact that the guidelines do not include minimum KPIs for ISMSs, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) principles for outsourcing and more specific requirements for adequate vulnerability/patch management and network segmentation. As a consequence, institutions do not know what is useful and what the auditor will demand. In contrast to this, the number of penetration tests is deemed too high. If tests for the effectiveness of the security measures are required after major changes, information security incidents and the installation of new internet-facing systems and once per year for critical and every 3 years for other applications, the information security organisation will spend most of its budget on penetration tests and will lose the support of the company in following up. The respondent recommends that it would be better to use the FFIEC wording in the ICT Examination Handbook: 'frequency and scope of a penetration test should be ... determined by the risk assessment process.'

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:85]
PARAGRAPH_78599: The EBA considers that a financial institution itself is responsible for their risk assessment and needs to have an understanding of what is useful for their situation. The guidelines do not consider that penetration tests and red team exercises should be mandatory, as testing should be proportionate, commensurate to the risk exposure of the institution and to the maturity of ICT and security risk management within the organisation. The guidelines are clarified by replacing 'foster' with 'consider good practices such as'.

PARAGRAPH_78652: One respondent proposed changes to allow flexibility in handling weaknesses that are exposed by security tests and should have the flexibility to decide to defer updating a critical system to its next release, as an update might introduce more risk than does the risk of not fixing the weakness. Furthermore, management could be willing to accept the risk of not implementing a security measure ...: 'Financial institutions should continuously monitor and evaluate results of the security tests, and update their security measures on a risk-based approach accordingly. without undue delays in case of critical ICT systems. A risk treatment plan should be established including necessary compensative controls, in order to reduce risk, when patching is not an option.'

PARAGRAPH_78666: A number of comments were received regarding the testing frequency of 3 years. Some respondents suggested that the timing of 'every 3 years' should be deleted since this paragraph already provides for a risk-based approach, so there is no need to be more prescriptive. Another respondent considered that testing all the critical security measures on an annual basis and all non-critical systems every 3 years can be too much for complex organisations and that these requirements should be adapted to the kind of organisation we are talking about. Other respondents considered that the period of 3 years is a long span of time and that tests for all critical ICT systems should be performed at least on an annual basis, i.e. based on the asset classification process previously mentioned. In 3 years, technology revolutions happen and attack vectors evolve in impressive ways.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:89]
PARAGRAPH_78689: One respondent suggested that it seems that the requirement does not take into account the current trends in payment services technology. Paragraph 50 requires all PSPs to test security measures implemented in payment terminals and devices used to provide payment services, payment terminals and devices used to authenticate the user of payment services and devices and software supplied by the payment service provider to the user of the payment service to enable the user to generate/receive an authentication code. In the case of mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, the requirement to test each device model is not unrealistic, but it may be considered excessively burdensome. Therefore, testing could be restricted to a limited range of models, reducing the potential choice of compliant mobile devices. It is suggested that the requirement to test mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, etc.) be limited to the testing of the operating system only (e.g. Android, IOS, Windows Mobile).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:89]
PARAGRAPH_78690: The EBA is of the view that, as a rule, PSPs should enter into contracts with their outsourcing providers for the provision of payment services. Any form of contract should be concluded between the PSP and its outsourcer, not with the PSU. The EBA is aware that in some cases PSPs may not have a close relationship with sub-outsourcing providers because the whole process is under the control of the primary outsourcing provider. The EBA is also aware that PSPs might not enter into contracts with suppliers of end user devices, such as tablets or smartphones, or providers of operating systems.

PARAGRAPH_78744: Two respondents suggested that the documentation of processes and procedures need not be performed and approved by the members of the management body but by executive/senior management structures. Management body approval of the main features of the operations and a corresponding mandate to a responsible member of staff are sufficient. Certain management body responsibilities outlined in the guidelines should be amended to permit delegation where deemed adequate. The proposed wording is 'Financial institutions should manage their ICT operations based on documented processes and procedures.' Another commented that it is not possible that the management body would 'implement' any policy that it would approve, as this extends beyond its strategic role in the governance of the organisation.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:93] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_78756: A few respondents commented on the use of automation in ICT operations. Some said that the guidelines should remain principle based and suggested removing any reference to the automation of ICT operations, as firms may achieve operational efficiency through means other than automation. These respondents recognised the benefits of automation but also highlighted a number of potential risks, so in certain processes it still makes sense to include expertise in decisions. A change in wording was proposed: 'To increase the efficiency of financial institutions' ICT operations, fFinancial institutions are encouraged to automise as far as possible, automate ICT operations (e.g. job scheduling processes, monitoring of ICT systems, maintenance and repair of financial institutions' assets, shift handover} to minimise potential errors arising from the execution of manual tasks. Financial institutions should ensure that the performance of their ICT operations is aligned with the business requirements.' Another respondent suggested removing the requirement for automation and to add 'consider where automation of ICT operations may provide material benefit in the minimisation of potential errors arising from the

'To increase the efficiency of financial institutions' ICT operations, financial institutions should, as far as possible, automate ICT operations (e.g. job scheduling processes, monitoring of ICT systems, maintenance and repair of financial institutions' assets, shift handover) to minimise potential errors arising from the execution of manual tasks.

PARAGRAPH_78778: One respondent recommended that the guidelines remain principle based on how firms decide to increase ICT operational efficiencies and suggested removing the prescriptive requirements on how firms achieve this outcome. The respondent recognised the benefits of ICT operations capacity monitoring and performance management; however, the implementation of such programmes for financial service firms operating globally is often costly, complex and may not deliver immediately the benefits expected. For example, the logging and monitoring of procedures for critical ICT operations may not increase operational efficiency if not implemented appropriately.

PARAGRAPH_78802: One respondent suggested that clarification was needed on the extent to which financial institutions have to document interdependencies between the different ICT assets. One respondent suggested specifying the desired outcomes in asset, configuration or change management, to which ICT professionals can adhere using verifiable and commercially reasonable means. The respondent argued that, while it is reasonable to require ICT professionals to understand the components and/or systems on which an application or system depends, this is not true in the opposite direction. For example, while the operating system version on which a particular application relies is an important dependency to understand, it would not be practical for an operating system vendor to know all of the software packages that may at some point run on that operating system.

PARAGRAPH_78828: Two respondents recommended that the guidelines remain principle based in how firms decide to implement data and ICT systems backups and restoration procedures and to remove prescriptive requirements on how firms achieve this outcome. One respondent suggested that backup requirements should be aligned to the business recovery requirements. System criticality is more aligned to the BIA for technology in business continuity management. Another respondent recognised the benefits of ICT systems and data backups and restoration. However, it suggested that further considerations may be required (e.g. impact tolerance levels, firms risk appetite).

PARAGRAPH_78829: These guidelines requires financial institutions to define their backup and recovery processes requirements, in line with business recovery requirements and the criticality of the data and the ICT systems. However, the EBA does not specify how this should be achieved. Hence, the EBA has defined principles rather than specific requirements.

PARAGRAPH_78898: One respondent suggested further considering the impact on firms operating across multiple jurisdictions of having to comply with multiple requirements or reporting obligations. There is an increasing risk of the proliferation of incident reporting requirements for firms, which may increase the reporting burden on firms, as well as divert resources from actual risk mitigation. The respondent suggested that the EBA should consider how to support efficient reporting mechanisms, such as 'provide once, satisfy many', or how reporting information could be aggregated by authorities and shared with industry to support preparedness and response. The respondent was supportive of an effective and coordinated incident response plan that would support the industry in the event of a large-scale disruption, which may require input and testing with the public sector's response (e.g. an EU blueprint).

PARAGRAPH_78921: 4.6. ICT project and change management Agile principle

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:100]
PARAGRAPH_78922: Many respondents suggested that Section 4.6, 'ICT project and change management', should be redesigned to allow modern project management practices to be used for system/application development (e.g. Agile, Tribes). It was suggested to focus more on what is to be achieved (control principles) and less on how this should be achieved. Draft requirements could be perceived to dictate that project management and system development methodologies should follow the waterfall model, i.e. a linear sequential design approach for software development. Most financial institutions have already or are in the process of adopting agile software development. This is another example of these guidelines limiting the options available for financial institutions, in this case not only related to risk management but also to business development. One respondent proposed amending this section in such a way that it facilitates agile working in ICT development projects. Financial institutions have increasingly adopted agile ways of working in the development of software. This means that the requirements described in paragraph 73, which envisage that the process of the development of ICT systems should include a), b), c) and d), cannot be met by the financial institutions that use agile methods. In competitive environments, the need for flexibility, especially with the limited separation of duties and new ways of organising projects, is seen as mandatory.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:100]
PARAGRAPH_78923: The EBA has updated all of Section 3.6 to make it more principle based and technology neutral. The EBA defined the desired outcomes of these guidelines and the principles that institutions can apply to achieve these outcomes. The guidelines do not seek to define specific ways in which the outcomes can be achieved, and it is up to institutions to decide how best to apply these principles. The EBA applied the principle of proportionality throughout the text and focused on creating technology agnostic and future proof guidance.

PARAGRAPH_78935: One respondent suggested that the guidelines should rather focus on providing clarification of supervisory expectations regarding adequate governance and control related to (material) changes. The respondent considered that some requirements of the draft guidelines are expendable and not fit for purpose. In particular, where the guidelines outline the implementation of ICT-related changes primarily through a project setup, there is a lack of insight on state-of-the-art ICT challenges. The respondent considered that the draft guidelines focused too strongly on project setup, which did not fit the actual practice in, among other things, software development. Software is increasingly being developed continuously or in agile project setups (e.g. Scrum) rather than in so-called 'waterfall' project setups (as particularly indicated in paragraph 68 of the draft guidelines). Another respondent advised adding a provision in Section 4.6 on the use of control mechanisms, regardless of the methodology employed. One respondent suggested the possibility of including the draft guidelines on ICT project management (i.e. Section 4.6.1) as general requirements for, for example, project and change management, into the Guidelines on internal governance under Directive 2013/36/EU (EBA/GL/2017/11). It argued that the draft Guidelines on ICT project management, as specified under Section 4.6.1 of the draft guidelines, do not contain any ICT-related specifications but constitute general requirements on project management that are applicable to a multitude

One respondent commented that the proposed methodology suggests following a one-solution model; however, the respondent expressed a view that in DevOps product development scenarios, other methods should be considered. The risk can be mitigated by breaking the changes into classes of risk and automating testing batteries for defined risk levels. For example, lower risk issue testing can then be automated, thereby focusing development

PARAGRAPH_79130: One respondent requested clarity on the desired outcome of this measure. The respondent said that financial institutions' processes for acquisition and development of ICT systems should not necessarily apply to systems developed outside the organisations. For instance, if telephone systems are outsourced to a provider, the ICT function should manage the performance of the outsourced telecommunications service through an SLA and understand the risks and controls surrounding this outsourcing.

The EBA is of the view that, as a rule, PSPs should enter into a contract with their outsourcing providers for the provision of payment services. Any form of contract should be concluded between the PSP and its outsourcer, not with the PSU. The EBA is aware that in some cases PSPs may not have close a relation with sub-outsourcing providers because the whole process is under the control of the primary outsourcing providers.

PARAGRAPH_79220: One respondent made a general comment that most of the guidelines regarding business continuity are acceptable. In some cases, however, the complexity of a financial institution is taken into account and at other times the requirements for the content of plans (BCP and recovery plans) are much too detailed. This will lead to plans that are unmanageable, unmaintainable and practically not usable.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:115]
PARAGRAPH_79228: Two respondents stated that it was unclear why BCM is treated as a subset of ICT risk. One respondent commented that this may lead to a new layer of requirements as opposed to business continuity planning for business as a whole, and risks confusion, mixed control standards and the potential duplication of effort with no material benefit. The approach in the guidelines diverges from the emerging approaches and supervisory focus on end-to-end service availability and accountability at the service level. Another respondent recommended reconsidering the inclusion of the BCM elements outlined in this section to avoid introducing unnecessary complexity to institutions and a potentially siloed approach to BCM. By setting specific requirements for one function (i.e. ICT), at the expense of all other functions, the guidelines would undermine this emerging approach. They would create a discrete and additional layer of BCM requirements specifically for ICT, as opposed to the business as a whole.

PARAGRAPH_79229: BCM is not a subset of ICT and security risk. However, in the context of these guidelines, BCM is an important concept for the mitigation of ICT and security risks. On completely separating BCP from business, the EBA's view is that it would be counterproductive to separate ICT from the rest of the business process; thus, these are considered where relevant (see comment on Section 3.7). The EBA updated the executive summary with the following clarification with regard to Section 3.7: 'Section 3.7 specifies expectations with regard to business continuity management and developing response and recovery plans, including testing, and their consequent updating based on the testing results.

PARAGRAPH_79238: It argued that this section of the guidelines varies from providing very specific guidance for ICT functions to providing more strategic requirements for an institution's overall BCM. The respondent said that the guidance applies a narrow lens to BCM, which may deflect focus from other, equally important, impact types and that effective assurance for large global banks relies on an approach that can be consistently applied across all business divisions and jurisdictions.

PARAGRAPH_79240: Paragraph 83

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:116]
PARAGRAPH_79241: One respondent suggested that this could refer to the preparation phase of BCM when high-availability solutions (e.g. redundancy, data mirroring) can minimise the probability of an ICT system and/or service outage. This 'going concern' approach should be given at least as much emphasis in the BCM process as is given to those preparations that activate after the ICT disaster happens ('gone concern'), where truly the main concerns are limiting losses, disaster containment and making the systems operable again.

PARAGRAPH_79245: One respondent proposed that, although financial market infrastructures (FMIs) are a subset of the bank's interdependencies, Section 4.7 (including paragraphs 93 to 95) should caveat the guidelines with an appropriate qualifying statement to exempt banks from the responsibility of FMIs' business continuity planning and ongoing BCM governance. The respondent explained that financial institutions are reliant on third party service providers, including FMIs as payment, clearing and settlement operators, to ensure continuity of services to the customer. FMIs are subject to regulatory requirements for their resilience framework (such as the ECB's cyber resilience oversight guidance for FMIs or the principles for FMIs issued by the BIS and IOSCO). However, it is not always within the control of an individual bank or financial institution to mandate or ensure compliance of an

PARAGRAPH_79265: One respondent suggested amending paragraph 84 in such a way that a scenario analysis is not expected to be a mandatory part of a BIA. They commented that, as part of sound business continuity management, financial institutions should conduct a BIA by means of, among other things, scenario analysis. They pointed out that, according to their understanding, the scope of the BIA is to analyse a financial institution's exposure to severe business disruptions. The impact derived from such disruptions does not change depending on the underlying scenario (the root cause triggering the disruption). Consequently, scenario analyses do not provide added value within this context. In contrast to this, scenario analyses can add value in other areas of business continuity management, such as business continuity planning, response planning and testing.

PARAGRAPH_79306: Some respondents suggested removing any reference to prescriptive activities expected from the management body, such as the documentation and approval of business continuity plans (paragraph 86) or the requirement that identified deficiencies resulting from tests should be analysed, addressed and reported to the management body (paragraph 96). The respondent also suggested reconsidering the need for the management body to approve specific risk-type policies. Another respondent commented that the management body should approve the strategy but not the specific BCPs of all functions; therefore, approval of BCPs should be done by the executive management. One respondent proposed adding the designation 'documented and approved by appropriate management body or responsible management', in order to cater for different internal organisation structures. Also the term 'management body' refers to board level and BCPs are usually described at a much more technical level than the board is used to.

The management body in its supervisory function oversees and challenges the management function and provides appropriate advice.

PARAGRAPH_79329: One respondent suggested that financial institutions need to assess their dependencies from third parties and, where necessary, analyse whether the business continuity and disaster recovery measures put in place by third parties satisfies/aligns with the requirements of the financial institutions. One respondent requested that Section 4.7.2 should reflect more the BCP process and its connection with third party vendors - BCPs must cover this area - than the continuity related to services provided by external parties.

PARAGRAPH_79330: Section 3.7.1 refers to the necessary considerations for the BIA, which should consider third parties as per Section 3.3.2. Furthermore, more guidance on BCM related to third party providers relationships is provided in the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing. For clarification, paragraph 78 has been revised to include a reference to 'third parties': '[ ... ]The BIAs should also consider the criticality of the identified and classified business functions, supporting processes, third parties and information assets, and their interdependencies, in accordance with Section 3.3.3.'

PARAGRAPH_79334: RTO is an objective, since meeting the envisaged time is never guaranteed. In addition, the term MTO is much less known, and, in practice, RTO covers MTO. The EBA has updated the text of paragraph 81 to make it clearer that the objective of the BCPs is to recover processes within RTO: 'Financial institutions should put BCPs in place to ensure that they can react appropriately to potential failure scenarios and that they are able to recover and maintain the operations of their critical business activities after a disruption within a recovery time objective (RTO, the maximum time within which a system or process must be restored after an incident) and a recovery point objective (RPO, the maximum time period during which it is acceptable for data to be lost in the event of an incident).'

PARAGRAPH_79344: One respondent viewed imposing a sector critical standard that required entities to establish a specific RTO for their sector critical systems as impractical, technically infeasible and potentially a risk to financial stability and a contagion risk. A more practical and feasible approach is one that focuses more broadly on resumption of service, measured by the entity's best efforts to ensure the ability to safely meet contractual and regulatory service obligations.

PARAGRAPH_79348: One respondent suggested that application would be facilitated and confusion avoided by re-using established and well-known definitions from international standards when available, e.g. the ISO 22301 standard definitions for RTO and RPO. It proposed to (1) align the definition of the RTO with ISO 22301: 'The period of time following an incident within which a product or service must be resumed, or activity must be resumed, or resources must be recovered.'; and (2) align the definition of the RPO with ISO 22301: 'The point to which information used by an activity must be restored to enable the activity to operate on resumption.'

PARAGRAPH_79448: One respondent requested a clarification in the case of including 'an adequate set of severe but plausible testing scenarios'. It raised a question of whether if the critical functions are tested independently, that is first a critical function is recovered and then another, and so on, it can it be considered to be a severe testing scenario.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:125] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_79449: An institution's BCP planning and testing should be based on a BIA and the respective criticality assessment of business processes.

PARAGRAPH_79452: One respondent suggested that there should be flexibility in the execution of the disaster recovery tests and suggested replacing 'should' with 'could'. The proposed change in wording is 'This should could include the switch-over of critical business functions [ ... ]'. Another respondent suggested removing the second sentence, as the switch-over called for under paragraph 95(a) is impracticable and harbours additional risks - no backup system is available for the duration of testing. "This should include the switch over of critical business functions, supporting processes and information assets to the disaster recovery environment and demonstrating that it can run them for a sufficiently representative period of time, and that it can restore normal functioning afterwards.'

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:125]
PARAGRAPH_79453: The guidelines need to set out requirements and could not provide the necessary requirement for such a test. The EBA considers that testing the switch-over of critical business functions is necessary for all institutions, but the requirement provides sufficient flexibility, as it guides institutions to perform tests in a certain way, but also allows them to use different methods to achieve the same outcome.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:126] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_79463: One respondent commented that this paragraph suggests that use of redundant infrastructure (e.g. servers, data centres) must be implemented, but the requirement to have such infrastructure at those levels should be a result of a BIA, risk assessment analysis and the RTO parameters defined and the ability of the financial institution to recover services within the RTO time. If the RTO time does not exceed the maximum time and the financial institution is able to recover its services to normal operations in their primary location, then an extra recovery environment may not be required.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:126]
PARAGRAPH_79464: The guidelines allow that individual systems redundancy is a mechanism to ensure ongoing resilience, whereas paragraph 89(a) refers to testing disaster recovery. Also, please note that paragraph 89 mentions 'until critical operations are re-established'. This highlights that this is not a blanket requirement for everything. The EBA considers that financial institutions should test existing infrastructure and not create additional structures.

PARAGRAPH_79475: One respondent commented that while the term 'PSP' is used throughout the guidelines, certain requirements in this section seem to be only applicable to either a credit institution or a TPP. The guidelines should therefore specify when a requirement applies to all types of PSPs and when they are directed specifically at an account servicing payment service provider (ASPSP), a payment initiation service provider (PISP) and/or an account information service provider (AISP). Specific reference was made to paragraphs 101 to 103, that in their view should only apply to ASPSPs. Establishing or disabling specific payment functionalities should be initiated and processed only by these entities,

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:126]
PARAGRAPH_79476: The EBA considers that all guidelines should apply to all PSPs so as not to favour specific business models and to ensure technological neutrality. Therefore, the guidelines require all security measures to be complied with by each addressee in relation to the payment services they provide, regardless of the size of the PSP and the business model followed. However, the guidelines are subject to the principle of proportionality, set out in Section 3.1, which means

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:127] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_79488: One respondent suggested that to make the relationship between the TPPs and the ASPSPs transparent for PSUs, the PSU should always be made aware by TPPs that they are not acting on behalf of the ASPSP. This will help ensure stronger consumer protection, as it will allow PSUs to make more informed decisions and maintain consumers' trust in the developing payments system. In order to prevent the trust that the PSUs have in the ASPSPs from being misused, the respondent suggested that Section 4.8 require the TPPs to clearly articulate to the PSUs whether or not it is acting on behalf of the ASPSP. To make such a statement obvious to the PSU, it could be provided in a disclaimer when an instruction is initiated or added to the TPP's documentation or guidance for the PSU.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:127]
PARAGRAPH_79489: The EBA agrees with the comment that the PSU should always be aware of which PSP is responsible for the service in question.

PARAGRAPH_79507: One respondent commented that the wording 'where product functionality permits' creates an ambiguity about whether this is optional or not. Another respondent suggested that this requirement appeared to be onerous from a merchant's point of view and requested a clarification of the desired outcome for this approach. For example, in many payment instances a PSP was integrated into the merchant application via an API call (white label service), to facilitate a simple integration into the business. The respondent noted that requirements in paragraph 100 will require many businesses to rewrite applications.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:128]
PARAGRAPH_79508: As it is a requirement under these guidelines, it is not to be seen as optional. However, it should only be provided if product functionality permits such an approach. A possible use could be disabling the ability to make foreign payments if the user wishes to. In this context the proportionality principle set out in Section 3.1 should also be considered.

With regard to corporate clients, PSPs could expect a more elaborate knowledge and understanding of risks and threats related to payment services than PSUs that are consumers. It should be appropriate to amend a risk-based approach to these provisions to enable differential treatment of PSUs with regard to the scope of information needed.
