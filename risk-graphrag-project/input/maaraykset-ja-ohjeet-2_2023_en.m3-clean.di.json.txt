If the supervised entity has already identified its customer and verified its identity for other reasons referred to in chapter 3, section (2)(1) of the AML Act, it does not have to re-verify the identity in connection with a suspicious transaction.

The verification of identity after the establishment of customer relationship may be justified for example in the context of non-life insurance involving risk that the customer would be otherwise unable to obtain an urgently needed insurance.

PARAGRAPH_34988: A consumer-customer finds out before leaving on a journey that he lacks travel insurance. Travel insurance is an insurance product typically associated with a low risk of money laundering and terrorist financing. To avoid a situation where the customer would be left uninsured, it may be necessary to establish a customer relationship even if the customer's identity cannot be verified at the time of inception of the customer relationship. Hence, the customer could purchase a travel insurance policy for example over the telephone. However, the customer's identity should be verified at the latest by the moment when insurance claims are paid or premiums are returned.

PARAGRAPH_35395: (155) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, the simplified procedure under chapter 3, section 8 of the AML Act does not allow supervised entities not to comply with one or more of the requirements provided in chapter 3, sections 2-4 and 6 of the AML Act concerning customer due diligence. The simplified procedure enables the adjustment of customer due diligence procedures and one, several, or all individual customer due diligence actions and ongoing customer monitoring actions.

PARAGRAPH_35398: (158) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, compliance with the simplified customer due diligence procedure as referred to in chapter 3, section 8 of the AML Act requires that the supervised entity has specifically assessed whether the customer or individual transaction involves such risk factor due to which the customer or transaction should not be classified as low-risk. In order that the supervised entity could make this assessment, it shall obtain adequate information on the customer and the nature and extent of its business.

However, the application of a simplified customer due diligence procedure requires that there are no such considerations that would elevate the ML/TF risk related to an individual customer relationship in a way that, when assessed as a whole, the risk associated with the customer relationship could no longer be considered low.

In accordance with preamble 33 of the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, refusing a business relationship with a person simply on the basis of the determination that he or she is a politically exposed person is contrary to the letter and spirit of said Directive and of the revised FATF Recommendations.

PARAGRAPH_35841: (19) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities assess the impacts of their activities, in addition to money laundering and terrorist financing, from the perspective of financial inclusion. In the assessment, attention should be paid on what kind of impacts there will be on a customer or category of customers if they are prevented from using certain products or services. The objective should be a balance of avoiding and mitigating risks on the one hand and providing a level playing field to economic activity in society on the other hand, particularly in respect of people in a vulnerable position.

PARAGRAPH_35865: (26) The FIN-FSA recommends supervised entities to assess whether the termination of customer relationship with a private customer could lead to an unreasonable outcome for the customer in circumstances where deficiencies in customer due diligence data pertaining to the verification of a private customer's identity are related to a failure by the supervised entity itself in the retention of the data and where the customer has significant impediments in the re-verification of identity in a manner and schedule required by the supervised entity.

PARAGRAPH_35866: (27) The FIN-FSA recommends supervised entities to assess whether the private customer has a justified and credible reason for not being able to re-verify identity and to assess the level of risk caused by the failure to re-verify identity from the perspective of overall risk associated with the customer relationship. In assessing the necessity of restrictive measures, supervised entities should also consider that the restrictive measures should not lead to the undue denial of access by private customers to financial services.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:FIVA_MOK] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:71]
PARAGRAPH_35867: (28) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, the obligation under chapter 3, section 1(3) of the AML Act to apply the customer due diligence measures provided in chapter 3 to risk-based assessment throughout the duration of the customer relationship requires that the supervised entity implements adequate and commensurate risk management methods to mitigate risks due to inability to re-verify the identity of a customer or take restrictive actions referred to in chapter 3, section 1(1) of the AML Act since it would lead to undue denial of access to financial services by private customers.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:FIVA_MOK] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:72]
PARAGRAPH_35883: A supervised entity has had a longstanding customer relationship with a private customer. According to the supervised entity's assessment, the customer relationship does not involve elevated risk of money laundering or terrorist financing. In establishing the customer relationship - and potentially also several times during the customer relationship - the supervised entity has verified the identity of the private customer, but this data has not been retained in a manner compliant with the AML Act or the data has been lost, for example in connection with systems changes made by the supervised entity.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:FIVA_MOK] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:72]
PARAGRAPH_35884: The supervised entity has requested the private customer to re-verify identity in accordance with chapter 3, section 2(1)(4) of the AML Act. However, the private customer is in a care facility and no longer has a valid proof of identity that could be used for the verification of identity, and due to health reasons has no possibility to visit the supervised entity in person. Neither does the private customer have the means to verify identity using strong electronic identification methods. The supervised entity has detected in ongoing monitoring that the customer's transactions are ordinary and often also regularly recurring (such as regular pension income and care facility charges).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:FIVA_MOK] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:72] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_35885: If restrictive measures would lead to an undue denial of access to financial services by the private customer, and the restrictive measures could not be regarded as necessary from the perspective of total risk associated with the customer relationship based on the supervised entity's risk assessment, when taking into account the customer's justified and credible reasons for not being able to re-verify identity, the implementation of restrictive measures would not be due and commensurate. In these circumstances, the supervised entity shall assess, instead of restrictive measures, the level of risk that would arise if the verification of identity has not been renewed and take measures that are sufficient and commensurate to manage the risk.
