PARAGRAPH_97869: 1. Executive summary

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_97870: Directive 2014/59/EU1, establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions, investment firms and related entities (the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, or BRRD) specifies a Union-wide framework for crisis prevention, management and resolution of these entities.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3] [RISK:SYSTEMIC_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_97871: These guidelines have been developed by the EBA, in close cooperation with the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), pursuant to Article 5(7) of the BRRD, and specify the range of scenarios of severe macroeconomic and financial distress which should be considered by institutions to test the effectiveness of recovery options and the adequacy of the indicators contained in their recovery plans.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_97872: The objective of a recovery plan is not to forecast the factors that could prompt a crisis, but rather to identify the actions that might be available to counter those factors and to assess whether they are robust enough and their nature is sufficiently varied to cope with a wide range of shocks of different natures. For this purpose, the scenarios of severe macroeconomic and financial distress should be designed in a way that they would threaten the failure of an institution or group if recovery measures were not implemented in a timely manner. However, given that the aim of a recovery plan is to prove the capacity to restore the viability of an institution, these scenarios should be designed as 'near-default' situations; i.e. they should bring an institution close to failure but no further. This element should be taken into consideration for example when considering using reverse stress testing to identify the most appropriate scenarios.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_97873: The guidelines stipulate that at least three scenarios of severe macroeconomic and financial distress should be included to ensure coverage of a system-wide event, an idiosyncratic event and a combination of system-wide and idiosyncratic events. In line with the principle of proportionality, global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) and other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs) identified pursuant to Article 131 of the CRD should include at least four scenarios.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_97874: The guidelines recognise that the risks that each institution faces vary significantly according to its business and funding model, its activities and structure, its size or its interconnectedness to other institutions or to the financial system in general. Moving from this premise, to ensure that recovery plans are tested against the main types of system-wide and idiosyncratic events, the guidelines identify the specific factors and events that should be taken into account in determining the appropriate scenarios. These factors have been selected as those that most typically threaten the failure of institutions or groups. However, the overriding principle remains

PARAGRAPH_97880: that the scenarios should be based on the events and factors that are the most relevant to the institution or group. Hence, different events should be used where those are more relevant. On this basis and in line with the provisions of the BRRD on the assessment of recovery plans and the related technical standards pursuant to Article 6(8), competent authorities will assess the adequacy of the scenarios chosen by the banks.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_97881: The EBA launched a public consultation on 20 May 2013 (EBA/CP/2013/09) on the guidelines. The decision behind this early consultation stage was to allow phasing of the delivery of the large number of technical standards/guidelines that the EBA is required to produce as mandated by the BRRD. By the time the consultation was launched, the EBA was mandated to develop technical standards for the range of scenarios to be used by firms to test their recovery plans. Following the change of the mandate, the draft technical standards have been transposed to fit the structure of the guidelines, whilst also taking into account the feedback received from respondents during the consultation period.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_97882: The comments received from stakeholders have been considered. Comments, the EBA's analysis and any consequent changes to the guidelines are reported in the feedback table at the end of this paper.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_97883: The guidelines are structured into three titles. The first title establishes the subject matter and scope of the guidelines. Title 2 provides design principles for the range of scenarios and the range of scenarios to be considered. Finally, Title 3 determines when the guidelines take effect.

PARAGRAPH_97888: 2. Background and rationale

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_97889: At the international level, any initiatives on recovery and resolution planning are carried out under the auspices of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), which in its Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions2 identifies the essential elements of recovery and resolution plans, and recommends recovery and resolution plans to be in place at least for any financial institution that could be systemically significant or critical if it fails.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_97890: At the EU level, co-legislators have adopted Directive 2014/59/EU (the BRRD), establishing a recovery and resolution framework in the European Union. The EBA has developed these guidelines in accordance with the mandate contained in Article 5(7) of the BRRD, which mandates the EBA to develop guidelines to specify the range of scenarios of severe macroeconomic and financial distress to be used to assess the arrangements that institutions have in place and the measures that would be adopted to maintain or restore the institutions' viability in a timely manner.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_97892: The BRRD stipulates in Article 5(6) that the competent authorities should ensure that firms test their recovery plans against a range of scenarios of severe macroeconomic and financial distress, varying in their severity, including system-wide events, legal entity-specific stress and group-wide stress, while Article 7(6) requires group recovery plans to include a range of recovery options specifying actions to address those scenarios. At the same time Article 5(7) of the BRRD mandates the EBA to develop, in close cooperation with the ESRB, guidelines specifying the range of scenarios to be used for the purposes of Article 5(6).

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_97893: Following this mandate, these guidelines are prepared taking into account the FSB Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions, the FSB Guidance on Recovery Triggers and Stress Scenarios, and current supervisory practices. The guidelines cover the key elements and essential issues that should be addressed by institutions when developing severe macroeconomic and financial distress scenarios against which the recovery plan will be tested.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_97894: Drafting a recovery plan is incumbent upon institutions or groups and is to be undertaken prior to a crisis in order to assess the potential options that an institution or a group could itself implement to restore financial strength and viability should the institution or group come under severe stress. Recovery plans must be based on the assumption that extraordinary public financial support would not be provided. Financial institutions are responsible for drafting and owning their own plans, but they will be assessed by the relevant competent authority or authorities.

PARAGRAPH_97900: The objective of preparing severe macroeconomic and financial distress scenarios is to define a set of hypothetical and forward-looking events against which the impact and feasibility of the recovery plan will be tested. The objective of the recovery plan is not to forecast the factors that could prompt a crisis, but rather to identify the options that might be available to counter those factors and to assess whether they are sufficiently robust and if their nature is sufficiently varied to cope with a wide range of shocks of different natures. Institutions or groups should use an appropriate number of system-wide financial distress scenarios and idiosyncratic financial distress scenarios to test their recovery planning. Severe macroeconomic and financial distress scenarios used for recovery planning should be designed so that they would threaten the failure of the institution or group concerned if the institution or group did not implement recovery measures in a timely manner.

PARAGRAPH_97907: 1. This document contains guidelines issued pursuant to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority), amending Decision No 716/2009/EC and repealing Commission Decision 2009/78/EC ('the EBA Regulation'). In accordance with Article 16(3) of the EBA Regulation, the competent authorities and financial institutions must make every effort to comply with the guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_97908: 2. The guidelines specify the EBA's view on appropriate supervisory practices within the European System of Financial Supervision or on how Union law should be applied in a particular area. The EBA therefore expects all competent authorities and financial institutions to whom the guidelines are addressed to comply with them. The competent authorities to whom the guidelines apply should comply by incorporating them into their supervisory practices as appropriate (e.g. by amending their legal frameworks or their supervisory processes), including cases where the guidelines are directed primarily at institutions.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:12] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_97989: 22. As documented in the Commission's impact assessment of the BRRD, during the financial crisis, many institutions or groups did not have plans in place to achieve recovery in various situations of financial distress. Institutions or groups were therefore insufficiently prepared to adopt and implement appropriate measures to promptly address issues such as severe liquidity shortages and capital depletion.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:12]
PARAGRAPH_97990: 23. The Commission proposed that credit institutions and investment firms prepare recovery plans in which they specify the arrangements they have in place or the measures that they themselves would adopt to take early action to restore their long-term viability in the event of a material deterioration of their financial situation in situations of financial stress. Institutions or groups would be required by supervisors to test their recovery plans against a range of scenarios of severe macroeconomic and financial distress, varying in their severity, including system-wide events, legal entity-specific stress and group-wide stress.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:12]
PARAGRAPH_97992: 24. The BRRD mandates the EBA, in close cooperation with the ESRB, to develop guidelines specifying the range of scenarios to be used for the purposes of Article 5(6). This is to avoid national competent authorities (NCAs) making substantially divergent requirements to these severe macroeconomic and financial distress scenarios, which may create uncertainty

PARAGRAPH_97999: Technical options considered

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:13]
PARAGRAPH_98000: 26. When preparing the guidelines the EBA considered whether:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:13]
PARAGRAPH_98001: · A1 - to add the requirement of producing an upside and downside case for each scenario tested, to test for possible extreme positive and negative events of the stress considered in each scenario; or

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:13]
PARAGRAPH_98002: · A2 - not to require any additional test of extreme positive and negative events in addition to the stress parameters already considered in each scenarios.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:13] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_98003: 27. The EBA decided to abstain from adding this specification and selected option A2. This decision was motivated by the fact that option A1 would create an excessive burden on institutions by unnecessarily increasing the number of scenarios against which they need to test their recovery plans. In addition, the added benefit of testing against a less severe scenario next to a severe (financial distress) scenario would be in some cases very limited: if an institution is capable of implementing recovery measures in a severe scenario, it will most likely also be able to implement these measures in a less severe scenario.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:13]
PARAGRAPH_98004: 28. The EBA considered also whether:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:13]
PARAGRAPH_98005: · B1 - to specify a fixed type and number of scenarios to be tested; or

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:13]
PARAGRAPH_98006: . B2 - to leave the type and number of scenarios to be tested to the discretion to the NCAs.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:13] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_98007: 29. Given that the design of the appropriate scenarios depends on the specific characteristics of each institution (activity, size, interconnectedness, business and funding model, etc.), the guidelines cast on institutions the responsibility of selecting relevant scenarios and vest NCAs with the task of assessing the appropriateness of the chosen scenarios. However, at least three scenarios are required by the guidelines (one covering a system-wide event, one covering an idiosyncratic event and one covering a combination of both types of events), and in order to build these scenarios the events identified in paragraphs 12-18 of the guidelines must be duly considered by institutions/NCAs while designing/assessing the scenarios. However, considering that the quality and effectiveness of the scenarios is strictly dependent on each firm's characteristics and weaknesses, relevant scenarios can be built considering events different from those provided by paragraphs 12-18. This option must be properly justified by the institution concerned and assessed by the competent authority.

PARAGRAPH_98012: Impact of the proposals

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:14]
PARAGRAPH_98014: 30. The costs of testing recovery plans against scenarios are mainly driven by the requirements incorporated in the BRRD itself. The guidelines specify only the range of scenarios against which recovery plans have to be tested. As a result, these guidelines will generate additional compliance costs within those Member States where fewer scenarios than the number proposed by the guidelines would have been required. These costs will mainly affect institutions, which will have to test these scenarios, and, to a lesser extent, the NCAs, which will have to verify whether the scenarios have been properly designed and tested.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:14] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_98016: 31. By specifying the range of scenarios that institutions or groups should use when testing their recovery plans, these guidelines will ensure that recovery plans are effectively tested according to similar benchmarks. They will ensure the existence of common minimum standards, for the benefit of the proper functioning of the single market, on the quality of the recovery plans of institutions established in the EU.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:14]
PARAGRAPH_98017: Proportionality of the proposal

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:14]
PARAGRAPH_98018: 32. When developing the requirements proposed in these guidelines, the EBA took into account the proportionality of its proposals with regard to institutions and other stakeholders. The requirements laid down on the range of scenarios for the recovery plan will depend on many factors (for instance the nature of the businesses, their size or interconnectedness to other institutions on funding conditions or on the economy in general). In general, the greater the size, complexity and interconnectedness of an institution (or banking group), the more resources it will need to design and develop the scenarios proposed.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:14]
PARAGRAPH_98019: 33. Furthermore, proportionality should also be addressed by how Member States are to apply Article 4 of BRRD, which allows Member States to determine the extent to which details of recovery plans are applied.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:15] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_98027: 35. The EBA launched a public consultation on 20 May 2013 (EBA/CP/2013/09) on the GL. The decision behind such an early consultation stage was to allow the delivery of the large number of technical standards/guidelines that the EBA is required to produce as mandated by the BRRD to be phased.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:15]
PARAGRAPH_98028: 36. The consultation period lasted for three (3) months and ended on 20 August 2013.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:15]
PARAGRAPH_98029: 37. By the time the consultation was launched, Article 5(7) of the BRRD mandated the EBA to develop technical standards for the range of scenarios to be used by firms to test their recovery plans. The following summary and table are composed on the basis of the feedback received for the draft technical standards, although the mandate was subsequently changed to require guidelines in the legislative procedure. Following the change to the mandate, the draft technical standards were transposed to fit the structure of guidelines, whilst also taking into account the feedback received from respondents during the consultation period.

PARAGRAPH_98031: In total, sixteen (16) responses were received; two (2) respondents asked for their response not to be published but the remainder were published on the EBA website.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:15]
PARAGRAPH_98032: On the whole, the respondents welcomed the proposals and the efforts to harmonise the practices with scenarios that are being used to test the recovery plans.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:15]
PARAGRAPH_98033: Many of the respondents welcomed the emphasis that scenarios should be used to test the recovery plan and to facilitate its assessment and the ability of the group to recover, rather than building recovery plans around a given set of scenarios.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:15]
PARAGRAPH_98034: Some of the respondents considered the proposals too detailed or prescriptive to fit individual institutions, advocating more flexibility. It was considered that 'over-engineered' scenarios may create a ranking or hierarchy of recovery options for each particular scenario. Furthermore, recovery plans need to be tailor-made for each institution/group and appropriately reflect its specificities.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:15]
PARAGRAPH_98035: The range of respondents' views was quite wide as far as the testing of the recovery plans on the group or individual level was concerned. Some respondents claimed that scenarios should be developed and tested at group level only, while others replied that they have already developed scenarios to test recovery plans both at individual and group level and considered these as useful.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:15]

PARAGRAPH_98191: Both options were covered in the responses, although a slight majority of the respondents replied that they had developed scenarios for both purposes (UniCredit, Santander, APB, Euroclear, AFME, one of the confidential responses). Three respondents confirmed having developed only group-specific scenarios (DB, BNPP, SBA). EBF was of the view that many/most European banks have developed group plans only. EBF also advocated that recovery planning should be adapted to the business model of the bank. This was endorsed by AFME ('no one-size-fits- all') and BBA ('scenarios should be flexible enough to be used both at group level as well as at individual level'). BBA was also of the view that the scope of scenarios to assess a recovery plan should reflect the scope of the recovery plan being tested.

PARAGRAPH_98192: The guidelines follow the mandate of the Level 1 text, according to which recovery plans need to consider a range of scenarios of severe macroeconomic and financial stress, including system-wide events, legal entity-specific stress and group-wide stress.

The conclusion may be that this particular scenario would only materially impact one entity but may not satisfy the local supervisor, who would like to see a similar scenario impacting the local entity. It was also requested to clarify whether scenarios should be looked at from the approach where one or several group entities are in resolution, and how the rest of the group would cope with this. DB considered separate recovery plans, scenarios or measures unnecessary at individual entity level. This was echoed by FBF.

Santander encouraged going a step further with the RTS and providing clear, unequivocal RTS on the structure of scenarios and on the definition of severity and parameters that determine the likelihood of occurrence to ensure a level playing field in the single market.

Some respondents had further remarks on the matter. BNPP was of the view that a multitude of theoretical scenarios can cause the analysis of the recovery to be too prescriptive. BNPP saw no reason to link the number of scenarios to the size of institutions and used instead a small number of possible scenarios against which to assess the suitability of recovery options. BBA echoed this, arguing that too many scenarios may lead to too much analysis and produce too many details to be used effectively. BBA was also of the view that a distinction between slow- and fast-moving events may over-complicate the assessment, and that recovery plans should instead contain an indication of the likely time-frame for deployment.

Santander argued that not all supervisors and entities understand the term 'reverse stress' in the same way, ad argued that the EBA should provide a definition of reverse stress testing as well as specific examples. Santander was of the view that reverse stress tests should be complementary to other scenarios.

Santander was, however, also of the view that the principle of proportionality should always prevail. Accordingly, institutions should use an appropriate number of financial distress scenarios against which to test their recovery plans. Santander also argued that events such as the 'failure of a significant counterparty' and 'an adverse movement in the price of assets to which the institution or group is predominantly exposed' fall exclusively within the category of system-wide events and should not be considered as idiosyncratic events (Article 4(3)), as the failure of a significant counterparty will almost always occur during a period of widespread financial instability. Santander also welcomed greater conciseness concerning the impact of events on an entity's 'business model' and its 'reputation', as proposed under Article 3(2).

AFME also asked for clarification on how to distinguish scenario testing from other stress testing (echoed in the confidential response) and to exclude 'payment and settlement operations' from the assessment requirements for a recovery scenario (an issue more appropriate to the resolution). Following their concern on lack of flexibility, BBA suggests amending Articles 4(2) and 4(3) of the draft RTS to read 'In designing scenarios on system-wide events (idiosyncratic events), [ ... ] one or more of the following [ ... ]'. Euroclear welcomed future guidance on how precisely to express impacts and the level of detail needed in the description of scenarios. DB's response was positive and general in nature, welcoming the draft RTS approach for setting minimum high-level requirements and avoiding a prescriptive approach.

DB added that the costs of conducting the tests will vary according to the bank's size and complexity of its activities but the cost of developing scenarios should not, as the level of detail required to conduct a robust test should be consistent. Costs of developing new scenarios will be additional, but costs will be less for systemic scenarios than idiosyncratic ones. Furthermore, costs of developing scenarios escalate if multiple jurisdictions/legal entities are involved. Santander stated that the costs of developing financial distress scenarios are likely to be proportional to the complexity of the firm but not to its size. BNPP was of the view that scenarios should not be developed in such detail that these were to have significant additional costs, regardless of the size of the institution.
