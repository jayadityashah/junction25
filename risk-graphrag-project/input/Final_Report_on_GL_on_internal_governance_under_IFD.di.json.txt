[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_104254: For several years now, internal governance issues have received increased attention from various international bodies. Their main aim has been to correct financial institutions' weak or superficial internal governance practices, including compliance with the framework to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing, as the reinforcement of internal governance arrangements is a critical issue for the sustainable growth of market-based financing.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_104255: Sound internal governance arrangements are fundamental if investment firms are to operate well as part of the financial system. Directive (EU) 2019/2034 sets out governance requirements for investment firms and, in particular, stresses the responsibility of the management body to ensure sound governance arrangements, the importance of a strong supervisory function that challenges management's decision-making and the need to establish and implement a sound risk strategy, risk appetite, risk culture and risk management framework.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_104256: To further harmonise investment firms' internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms within the EU, in line with the requirements introduced by Directive (EU) 2019/2034, the European Banking Authority (EBA) is mandated by Article 26(4) of Directive (EU) 2019/2034 to develop guidelines in this area. The guidelines apply to investment firms as defined in Article 4(1)(1) of Directive (EU) 2014/65 that do not meet all of the conditions for qualifying as small and non- interconnected investment firms under Article 12(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/2033. These requirements apply regardless of the investment firms' governance structures (unitary board, dual board or other structure). However, the guidelines do not advocate or prefer any specific structure. The terms 'management body in its management function' and 'management body in its supervisory function' should be interpreted in accordance with the applicable law within each Member State.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_104257: The guidelines complete the various governance provisions in Directive (EU) 2019/2034, taking into account the principle of proportionality, by specifying the tasks, responsibilities and functioning of the management body, and the organisation of investment firms, including the need to create transparent structures that allow for the supervision of all their activities. The guidelines also specify in more detail the requirements under Directive (EU) 2019/2034 and aim to ensure the sound management of all risks. Risks need to be managed across all three lines of defence. While the business needs to manage its risks, the guidelines stress the responsibilities of the second line of defence (the independent risk management and compliance function) and also the third line of defence (the internal audit function).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_104258: The guidelines are consistent with the guidelines on internal governance for credit institutions and with international standards and, in particular, set out provisions that aim to foster a sound risk culture to be implemented by the management body, strengthening the management body's oversight of the investment firm's activities and implementing a sound risk management framework.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_104264: 1. Trust in the reliability of the financial system is crucial for its proper functioning and a prerequisite if it is to contribute to the economy as a whole. Consequently, effective internal governance arrangements are fundamental to the sustainable growth of market-based funding.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_104265: 2. In recent years, internal governance issues have received increased attention from various international bodies1. Their main aim has been to correct financial institutions' weak or superficial internal governance practices, as identified during the financial crisis and during ongoing supervision by competent authorities. In addition, there has recently been a greater focus on conduct-related shortcomings and activities in offshore financial centres, and in the area of money laundering and terrorist financing.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_104266: 3. In some cases, the absence of effective checks and balances within financial institutions resulted in a lack of effective oversight of management decision-making, which led to short- term and excessively risky management strategies. Weak oversight by the management body in its supervisory function has been identified as a contributing factor. The management body, both in its management function and, in particular, in its supervisory function, might not have understood the complexity of the business and the risks involved. Consequently, these bodies failed to identify and constrain excessive risk-taking in an effective manner.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_104267: 4. Internal governance frameworks, including internal control mechanisms and risk management, were often not sufficiently integrated within financial institutions or groups. These functions were not regarded as a high priority, which impacted the stability of markets as a result. In many investment firms there was a lack of a uniform risk methodology and terminology, which meant that there was no holistic view of all risks. Internal control functions often lacked appropriate resources, status and/or expertise.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_104268: 5. Conversely, sound internal governance practices helped some financial institutions to manage the financial crisis significantly better than others. These practices included the setting of an appropriate risk strategy and appropriate risk appetite levels, a holistic risk management framework and effective reporting lines to the management body.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_104269: 6. Against this backdrop, there is a clear need to address the potentially detrimental effects of poorly designed internal governance arrangements on the sound management of risk, to ensure effective oversight by the management body, in particular in its supervisory function, to promote a sound risk culture at all levels of investment firms and to enable competent authorities to supervise and monitor the adequacy of internal governance arrangements.

PARAGRAPH_104275: 7. To further harmonise investment firms' internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms within the EU, the EBA, in cooperation with the ESMA, is mandated under Article 26(4) of Directive (EU) 2019/2034 to develop guidelines in this area.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_104277: 9. Article 28 of Directive (EU) 2019/2034 sets out requirements for the involvement of the management body in risk management and the setting up of a risk committee for investment firms.

PARAGRAPH_104278: 10. In accordance with Article 25 of Directive (EU) 2019/2034 and Article 7 of Regulation (EU) 2019/2033, these guidelines apply on an individual and consolidated basis. For this purpose, parent undertakings and subsidiaries subject to Directive (EU) 2019/2034 must ensure that internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms in their subsidiaries are consistent and well integrated and that the governance arrangements on a consolidated basis are robust. In particular, it should be ensured that parent undertakings and subsidiaries subject to this Directive implement such arrangements, processes and mechanisms in their subsidiaries that are not subject to this Directive, including those established in third countries - including offshore financial centres.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_104279: 11. The guidelines should be read, taking into account and without prejudice to Articles 9, 16, 23 and 24 of Directive (EU) 2014/65, the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/5652 and the Commission Delegated Directive (EU) No 2017/5933, in conjunction with the EBA guidelines on sound remuneration policies for investment firms, the joint EBA and ESMA guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders, the EBA guidelines on the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP), the ESMA guidelines on certain aspects of the MiFID II compliance function requirements, the ESMA guidelines on product governance and the Regulatory Technical Standards on disclosures.

PARAGRAPH_104289: 13. Combating money laundering and terrorist financing is essential for maintaining the stability and integrity of the financial system. Uncovering the involvement of an investment firm in money laundering and terrorist financing might have an impact on its viability and on trust in the financial system. Together with the authorities and bodies (e.g. AML supervisors and financial intelligence units) responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering rules under Directive (EU) 2015/849, competent authorities have an important role to play in identifying and tackling weaknesses in this area. In this context, the guidelines clarify that identifying, managing and mitigating money laundering and financing of terrorism risks is part of sound internal governance arrangements and investment firms' risk management framework.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_104290: 14. In the same way, investment firms should take into account environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk factors within their risk management framework.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_104291: 15. The guidelines are intended to apply to all existing board structures without interfering with the general allocation of competences in accordance with national company law or advocating any particular structure. Accordingly, they should be applied irrespective of the board structure used (unitary or dual board structure or another structure) and across Member States. The management body, as defined in points (23) and (24) of Article 3(1) of Directive (EU) 2019/2034, should be understood as having management (executive) and supervisory (non-executive) functions.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_104292: 16. The terms 'management body in its management function' and 'management body in its supervisory function' are used throughout these guidelines without referring to any specific governance structure, and references to the management (executive) or supervisory (non- executive) function should be understood as applying to the bodies or members of the management body responsible for that function in accordance with national law.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_104293: 17. In Member States where the management body delegates, partially or fully, the executive function to a person or an internal executive body (e.g. a chief executive officer (CEO), management team or executive committee), the persons who perform these executive functions and direct the business of the institution on the basis of that delegation should be understood as constituting the management function of the management body. For the purposes of these guidelines, any reference to the management body in its management function should be understood as also including the members of the executive body or the CEO, as defined in these guidelines, even if they have not been proposed or appointed as formal members of an investment firm's governing body or bodies under national law.

PARAGRAPH_104298: 18. The management body is empowered to set the investment firm's strategy, objectives and overall direction, and oversees and monitors management decision-making. In its management function, the management body directs the investment firm. Senior management is accountable to the management body for the day-to-day running of the investment firm. In its supervisory function, the management body oversees and challenges the management function and provides appropriate advice. The oversight roles include reviewing the performance of the management function and the achievement of objectives, challenging the strategy, and monitoring and scrutinising the systems that ensure the integrity of financial information as well as the soundness and effectiveness of risk management and internal controls.

PARAGRAPH_104299: 19. Taking into consideration all the existing governance structures provided for by national laws, competent authorities should ensure the effective and consistent application of the guidelines in their jurisdictions in accordance with the rationale and objectives of the guidelines themselves. For this purpose, competent authorities may clarify the governing bodies and functions to which the tasks and responsibilities set forth in the guidelines pertain, where this is appropriate to ensure the proper application of the guidelines in accordance with the governance structures provided for under national company law.

PARAGRAPH_104303: 23. The guidelines are consistent with the 'three lines of defence' model in identifying the functions within investment firms responsible for addressing and managing risks. Investment firms should establish and maintain a permanent and effective compliance function that operates independently from the business it controls and, where appropriate and taking into account the application of the proportionality principle, establish and maintain risk management and internal audit functions that operate independently.

PARAGRAPH_104310: 24. The business lines, as part of the first line of defence, take risks and are directly and permanently responsible for their operational management. For that purpose, business lines should have appropriate processes and controls in place that aim to ensure risks are identified, analysed, measured, monitored, managed, reported and kept within the limits of the investment firms' risk appetite, and that the business activities are in compliance with external and internal requirements.

PARAGRAPH_104311: 25. Not only business lines, but also other functions or units, e.g. HR, legal or information technology, are responsible for managing their risks and having appropriate controls in place. Other functions or units are mainly exposed to operational and reputational risks that must be considered by the compliance function and risk management function when forming an enterprise-wide holistic view of all risks. All other functions or units should also be subject to monitoring and oversight by the independent risk management function, where established, and by the compliance function as part of a risk-based approach.

PARAGRAPH_104312: 26. The independent risk management function, where established, and the compliance function form the second line of defence. The risk management function facilitates the implementation of a sound risk management framework throughout the investment firm and is responsible for further identifying, monitoring, analysing, measuring, managing and reporting risks and forming a holistic view of all risks on an individual and, where applicable, consolidated basis. It challenges and assists in the implementation of risk management measures by the business lines in order to ensure that the processes and controls in place in the first line of defence are properly designed and effective. The compliance function monitors compliance with legal requirements and internal policies, provides advice on compliance issues to the management body and other relevant staff, and establishes policies and processes to manage compliance risks and to ensure compliance5. The compliance function and, where established, the risk management function intervene as necessary to ensure the modification of internal control and risk management systems within the first line of defence.

PARAGRAPH_104313: 27. The internal audit function, where established as an independent third line of defence, conducts risk-based and general audits and reviews the internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms to ascertain that they are sound and effective, implemented and consistently applied. The internal audit function is also in charge of the independent review of the first two lines of defence including other internal functions, units and business lines. Investment firms that do not establish an independent audit function must establish other appropriate audit policies and procedures. In any case, the ultimate responsibility for audits remains with the management body.

PARAGRAPH_104321: 29. The requirements on governance arrangements under the IFD are very similar to the requirements under the CRD and apply to investment firms, unless they meet all of the conditions to qualify as small and non-interconnected investment firms under Article 12(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/2033 (IFR) or are subject to the CRD requirements in accordance with Article 2(2) IFD.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:10] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_104322: 30. The CRD and IFD are both based on the same governance concepts and principles of good governance arrangements, while taking into account that investment firms are often smaller or less complex. Therefore a more proportionate approach is taken for such investment firms, in particular regarding the establishment of committees and control functions. Most investment firms that are now subject to the governance provisions under the IFD have been subject to the requirements under the CRD, and consistency should therefore be ensured to the extent possible to reduce the implementation costs for such firms and to ensure that consistent group-wide policies can be applied.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:10]
PARAGRAPH_104323: 31. The guidelines and the principle of proportionality cannot change the minimum requirements included in the IFD. The same holds true with regard to the requirements under MiFID that apply to all investment firms. All provisions within the guidelines are subject to the principle of proportionality, meaning that they are to be applied in a manner that is appropriate, taking into account in particular the investment firm's size, internal organisation and nature, and the complexity of its activities. However, the principle of proportionality does not mean that investment firms are permitted to not meet certain requirements, i.e. requirements cannot be waived unless the IFD explicitly allows for such waivers when the underlying conditions are met.

PARAGRAPH_104324: 32. The guidelines also specify the requirements under Article 26 of Directive (EU) 2019/2034, in particular with regard to the setting up of new structures e.g. in third countries, including also in offshore financial centres. These requirements aim to increase the transparency of and reduce the risks connected with such activities. Guidelines are also provided regarding investment firms' reporting on governance arrangements, including in relation to such structures.

PARAGRAPH_104325: 33. The guidelines aim to establish a sound risk culture in investment firms. Risks should be taken within a well-defined framework in line with the investment firms' risk strategy and risk appetite. This includes the establishment of and ensuring compliance with a system of limits and controls. Risks within new products6 and business areas, but also risks that may result from changes to investment firms' products, processes and systems, are to be duly identified, assessed, appropriately managed and monitored.

PARAGRAPH_104332: 34. To ensure objective decision-making, oversight and compliance with external and internal requirements, including investment firms' strategies and risk limits, investment firms should implement a conflict of interest policy and internal whistleblowing procedures.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:11] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_104333: 35. In order to manage conflicts of interest, the management body should ensure that a framework for the identification and, where necessary, mitigation of conflicts of interest is in place. The investment firm, its organisational substructures, staff and shareholders hold different interests that should be considered in such a framework in order to ensure that decisions are taken objectively without the undue influence of conflicts of interest. Examples of typical sources of conflicts of interest are diverging economic interests of different parties involved, or close links between decision-makers and contractual parties.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:11]
PARAGRAPH_104334: 36. The management body has the highest decision-making powers. Consequently, the identification and management of conflicts of interest of members of the management body and parties closely related to the members of the management body is a cornerstone of sound internal governance practices. Therefore, the guidelines also specify the measures that should be implemented by investment firms to prudently manage conflicts of interests that may arise from entering into transactions, including with members of the management body and their related parties. Those transactions may include loans where there is the possibility for investment firms to grant loans as ancillary services.

PARAGRAPH_104427: 17. Where applying these guidelines, competent authorities and investment firms should have regard to the principle of proportionality as set out in Article 26(3) of Directive (EU) 2019/2034 and specified further in Title I of these guidelines with a view to ensuring that the internal governance arrangements established by investment firms, including within the context of investment firm groups, are consistent with the individual risk profile of the firm and the group, commensurate with their size and internal organisation, relevant to their business model, suitable for the nature, scale and complexity of their activities and sufficient to effectively achieve the objectives of the relevant regulatory requirements and provisions.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:18] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_104428: 18. For the purposes of the previous paragraph, account should be taken of the variety of different business models under which investment firms and investment firm groups operate, indicatively as investment advisors, portfolio managers, trading venues, custodians, execution or wholesale brokers, trading firms, and others. Accordingly, for the internal governance arrangements to be deemed to be consistent with the individual risk profile of the firm and the group, commensurate with their size and internal organisation, relevant to their business model, suitable for the nature, scale and complexity of their activities and sufficient to effectively achieve the objectives of the relevant regulatory requirements and provisions, it should be ensured that investment firms with a more complex organisation or with a larger scale should have more sophisticated governance arrangements, while investment firms with a simpler organisation or with a smaller scale may implement simpler governance arrangements. Investment firms should, however, note that the size or systemic importance of an investment firm may not, in itself, be indicative of the extent to which an investment firm is exposed to risks.

PARAGRAPH_104719: 104. The policy should differentiate between conflicts of interest that persist and need to be managed permanently and conflicts of interest that occur unexpectedly with regard to a single event (e.g. a transaction or the selection of a service provider, etc.) and can usually be managed with a one-off measure. In all circumstances, the interests of the investment firm should be central to the decisions taken.

PARAGRAPH_104730: 106. The policy should specifically cover the risk of conflicts of interest at the level of the management body and provide sufficient guidance on the identification and management of conflicts of interest that may impede the ability of members of the management body to take objective and impartial decisions that aim to fulfil the best interests of the investment firms. Investment firms should take into consideration that conflicts of interest can have an impact on the independence of mind of members of the management body30.

PARAGRAPH_104735: 110. As part of their conflicts of interest policies for staff (Section 11) and the management of conflicts of interest of members of the management body as set out in paragraph 107, the management body should set out a framework for identifying and managing conflicts of interest in the context of granting loans and entering into other transactions, e.g. initial public offerings, service agreements or outsourcing agreements with members of the management body and their related parties.

PARAGRAPH_104742: 112. The conflicts of interest framework should ensure that decisions regarding loans and entering into other transactions with members of the management body and their related parties are taken objectively, without undue influence from conflicts of interest and are, as a general principle, conducted at arm's length.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:40]
PARAGRAPH_104743: 113. The management body should set out the applicable decision-making processes for granting loans and entering into other transactions with members of the management body and their related parties. This framework may provide for a differentiation between standard business transactions31 entered into in the ordinary course of business and concluded on normal market terms and staff transactions, which are concluded subject to conditions available to all staff. Furthermore, the conflicts of interest framework and decision-making process may differentiate between material and non-material loans or other material transactions, different types of loans and other transactions and the level of actual or potential conflicts of interest they may create.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:40]
PARAGRAPH_104744: 114. As part of the conflicts of interest framework, the management body should set appropriate thresholds (e.g. per product type, volume, or depending on the conditions) above which the transaction with a member of the management body or its related parties always requires approval by the management body. Decisions on material loans and other material transactions with members of the management body that are not being concluded under normal market terms, but subject to conditions available to all staff, should always be made by the management body.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:40]
PARAGRAPH_104745: 115. The member of the management body benefiting from such a material loan or other material transaction, or the member who is related to the counterparty, should not be involved in the decision-making process.

PARAGRAPH_104825: 139. As part of the overall internal control framework, investment firms should have a holistic investment firm-wide risk management framework extending across all their business lines and internal units, including internal control functions, recognising fully the economic substance of all their risk exposures including the risks the investment firm poses to itself, its customers and markets and liquidity risks, in particular those that can have a material impact on or deplete the level of own funds available. The risk management framework should enable the investment firm to make fully informed decisions on risk-taking. The risk management framework should encompass all risks as well as actual risks and future risks that the investment firm may be exposed to. Risks should be evaluated from the bottom up and from the top down, within and across business lines, using consistent terminology and compatible methodologies throughout the investment firm and at a consolidated level. All relevant risks should be encompassed in the risk management framework with appropriate consideration given to both financial and non-financial risks, including market, liquidity, concentration, operational, IT, reputational, legal, conduct, compliance with AML/CTF and other financial crime, ESG and strategic risks.

PARAGRAPH_104830: 140. An investment firm's risk management framework should include policies, procedures, risk limits and risk controls ensuring adequate, timely and continuous identification, measurement or assessment, monitoring, management, mitigation and reporting of the risks at the business line, investment firm and consolidated levels.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:46] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_104831: 141. An investment firm's risk management framework should provide specific guidance on the implementation of its strategies. This guidance should, where appropriate, establish and maintain internal limits consistent with the investment firm's risk appetite and commensurate with its sound operation, financial strength, capital base and strategic goals. An investment firm's risk profile should be kept within these established limits. The risk management framework should ensure that, whenever breaches of risk limits occur, there is a defined process to escalate and address them with an appropriate follow-up procedure.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:46]
PARAGRAPH_104832: 142. The risk management framework should be subject to independent internal review, e.g. performed by the internal audit function, and reassessed regularly against the investment firm's risk appetite, taking into account information from the risk management function and the risk committee, where established. Factors that should be considered include internal and external developments, including revenue changes; any increase in the complexity of the investment firm's business, risk profile or operating structure; geographic expansion; mergers and acquisitions; and the introduction of new products or business lines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:46]
PARAGRAPH_104833: 143. When identifying and measuring or assessing risks, an investment firm should develop appropriate methodologies including both forward-looking and backward-looking tools. The tools should include the assessment of the actual risk profile against the investment firm's risk appetite, as well as the identification and assessment of potential and stressed risk exposures under a range of assumed adverse circumstances against the investment firm's risk capacity. The tools should provide information on any adjustment to the risk profile that may be required. Investment firms should make appropriately conservative assumptions when building stressed scenarios.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:46]
PARAGRAPH_104834: 144. Investment firms should take into consideration that the results of quantitative assessment methodologies, including stress testing, are highly dependent on the limitations and assumptions of the models (including the severity and duration of the shock and the underlying risks). For example, models showing very high returns on economic capital may result from a weakness in the models (e.g. the exclusion of some relevant risks) rather than a superior strategy or excellent execution of a strategy on the part of the investment firm. The determination of the level of risk taken should not therefore be based only on quantitative information or model outputs; it should also comprise a qualitative approach (including expert judgement and critical analysis). Relevant macroeconomic environmental trends and data should be explicitly addressed to identify their potential impact on exposures and portfolios.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:46]
PARAGRAPH_104835: 145. The ultimate responsibility for risk assessment lies solely with the investment firm, which, accordingly, should evaluate its risks critically and should not rely exclusively on external assessments.

PARAGRAPH_104841: 147. In addition to the investment firms' own assessments, investment firms may use external risk assessments (including external credit ratings or externally purchased risk models). Investment firms should be fully aware of the exact scope of such assessments and their limitations.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:47]
PARAGRAPH_104842: 148. Regular and transparent reporting mechanisms should be established so that the management body, its risk committee, where established, and all relevant units in an investment firm are provided with reports in a timely, accurate, concise, understandable and meaningful manner and can share relevant information about the identification, measurement or assessment, monitoring and management of risks. The reporting framework should be well defined and documented.

PARAGRAPH_104843: 149. Effective communication and awareness regarding risks and the risk strategy is crucial for the whole risk management process, including the review and decision-making processes, and helps prevent decisions that may unknowingly increase risk. Effective risk reporting involves sound internal consideration and the communication of the risk strategy and relevant risk data (e.g. exposures and key risk indicators), both horizontally across the investment firms and up and down the management chain.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:55]
PARAGRAPH_104955: 204. An investment firm's business relies on several critical resources (e.g. IT systems, including cloud services, communication systems, core staff and buildings). The purpose of business continuity management is to reduce the operational, financial, legal, reputational and other material consequences arising from a disaster or extended interruption to these resources and consequent disruption to the investment firm's ordinary business procedures. Other risk management measures might be intended to reduce the probability of such incidents or to transfer their financial impact to third parties (e.g. through insurance).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:55] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_104956: 205. In order to establish a sound business continuity management plan, an investment firm should carefully analyse risk factors for, and its exposure to, severe business disruptions and assess (quantitatively and qualitatively) their potential impact, using internal and/or external data and scenario analysis. This analysis should cover all business lines and internal units, including the RMF or risk management procedures, and should take into account their interdependency. The results of the analysis should contribute to defining the investment firm's recovery priorities and objectives.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:55]
PARAGRAPH_104957: 206. On the basis of the abovementioned analysis, an investment firm should put in place:

PARAGRAPH_104959: b. recovery plans for critical resources to enable the investment firm to return to ordinary business procedures in an appropriate timeframe. Any residual risk from potential business disruptions should be consistent with the investment firm's risk appetite.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:55]
PARAGRAPH_104960: 207. Contingency, business continuity and recovery plans should be documented and carefully implemented. The documentation should be available within the business lines, internal units and RMF for staff in charge of risk management procedures, and should be stored on systems that are physically separated and readily accessible in case of contingency. Appropriate training should be provided. Plans should be regularly tested and updated. Any challenges or failures occurring in the tests should be documented and analysed, with the plans reviewed accordingly.

This analysis should provide an overview of the findings regarding the problem to be dealt with, the solutions proposed and the potential impact of these options.

PARAGRAPH_105053: 6. Considering that the IFD governance framework as such is equivalent to the requirements under the CRD, a short implementation period is sufficient. However, some of the requirements under the IFD require some limited changes to investment firms' internal governance arrangements and documentation. This concerns e.g. the establishment of a risk committee and a remuneration committee for investment firms whose value of on and off-balance sheet assets is on average more than EUR 100 million over the four-year period immediately preceding the given financial year, but also the diversity aspect and the conflicts of interest policy regarding related-party transactions. A few investment firms have previously not been subject to the CRD requirements. Hence, an application date of the guidelines that specify these requirements in detail of 30 April 2022 appears appropriate.

PARAGRAPH_105055: 7. The IFD requires investment firms that have on and off-balance sheet assets of on average more than EUR 100 million over the four-year period immediately preceding the given financial year to establish a risk committee. Guidance has been provided on the composition and tasks of this committee.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:61]
PARAGRAPH_105056: 8. Option A: the guidelines should follow exactly the same approach regarding the composition of this committee as for CRD institutions to ensure a consistent approach among sectors.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:61]
PARAGRAPH_105057: 9. Option B: the guidelines should follow a more proportionate approach, taking into account the nature and complexities of investment firms' activities. Where the number of members within the management body in its supervisory function is insufficient to ensure a sound composition of committees as set out in this section, the tasks of the committee may be delegated to one member of the management body in its supervisory function, who is supported as appropriate by staff. Committees may be composed of the same group of members, taking into account the criteria set out in Title I and the number of independent members of the management body in its supervisory function and the specific experience, knowledge and skills that are individually or collectively required for the committees. The reasoning for the composition of committees should be documented.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:62] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_105067: Regarding option A, the objective of the changes is to ensure that there is sufficient scrutiny in respect of decisions regarding such loans when they are granted and other transactions and that conflicts of interest in this context are managed appropriately. Not providing guidance on this aspect would not be effective and would not ensure that investment firms have sound governance arrangements in line with the IFD and MiFID. Documentation of loans is required to monitor the relevant practices .. In this case, investment firms should document loans with their management body and their related party. Minor additional costs are created, caused by specific additional documentation requirements that are necessary to ensure that the impact of such loans and the conflicts of interest they potentially create can be assessed by firms and competent authorities. However the level of detail has been reduced to take into account the fact that investment firms do not usually grant loans. In line with the principle of proportionality, the guidelines differentiate between requirements for material and non-material loans.

PARAGRAPH_105070: 13. The guidelines aim to further specify requirements under the IFD and to achieve harmonisation at the EU level. Given the need for Member States to implement the IFD provisions and to abide by the principles set out within the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, it is presumed that the guidelines do not lead to any conflicts regarding these matters. Investment firms' policies must be gender-neutral. Some aspects concerning equal opportunities and anti-discrimination have been further specified in the guidelines. In the same way as for CRD institutions, investment firms are required to document and monitor the trend in the gender pay gap.

PARAGRAPH_105079: 17. Option B: establishing a more proportionate approach, also to be consistent with the MiFID framework; a permanent and effective compliance function should be set up; firms are not required to set up an internal risk management function, where justified. However, firms should implement policies and process to achieve the same objectives and should have a sound and effective internal control framework.

PARAGRAPH_105081: 19. Option B is recommended to create consistency between the MiFID and CRD frameworks.

The Banking Stakeholder Group did not submit its views. The last response was submitted too late and will therefore not be published. The consultation concerned the whole draft guidelines on internal governance under the IFD, which complete the various governance provisions in Directive (EU) 2019/2034.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_105090: The main comments received challenged the fact that the draft guidelines are based on the current guidelines on internal governance, which - according to the respondents - is not in line with the intention of the IFD, which establishes a simplified and proportionate regime for investment firms. The respondents consider the draft guidelines to be too extensive for investment firms covered by them.

PARAGRAPH_105117: One respondent disagrees with the EBA's assessment that the CRD governance requirements already apply to all investment firms covered by the IFD governance rules. The definition of investment firms in the CRD/CRR does not encompass entities providing certain MiFID services without a licence to hold client money or to deal on their own account. For such limited licence firms that do not meet the thresholds in Article 12 IFR, the IFD framework lays down new governance requirements in addition to the MiFID.
