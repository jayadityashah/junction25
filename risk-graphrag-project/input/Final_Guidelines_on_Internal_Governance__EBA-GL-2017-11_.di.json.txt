[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_98661: In recent years, internal governance issues have received increased attention from various international bodies. Their main aim has been to correct institutions' weak or superficial internal governance practices, as identified during the financial crisis. Recently, there has been a greater focus on conduct-related shortcomings and activities in offshore financial centres.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_98662: Sound internal governance arrangements are fundamental if institutions individually and the banking system they form are to operate well. Directive 2013/36/EU reinforces the governance requirements for institutions and in particular stresses the responsibility of the management body for sound governance arrangements; the importance of a strong supervisory function that challenges management decision-making; and the need to establish and implement a sound risk strategy and risk management framework.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_98663: To further harmonise institutions' internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms within the EU in line with the requirements introduced by Directive 2013/36/EU, the European Banking Authority (EBA) is mandated by Article 74 of Directive 2013/36/EU to develop guidelines in this area. The guidelines apply to all institutions regardless of their governance structures (unitary board, dual board or other structure), without advocating or preferring any specific structure, as set out specifically in the scope of application. The terms 'management body in its management function' and 'management body in its supervisory function' should be interpreted throughout the guidelines in accordance with the applicable law within each Member State.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_98664: The guidelines complete the various governance provisions in Directive 2013/36/EU, taking into account the principle of proportionality, by specifying the tasks, responsibilities and organisation of the management body, and the organisation of institutions, including the need to create transparent structures that allow for supervision of all their activities; the guidelines also specify requirements aimed at ensuring the sound management of risks across all three lines of defence and, in particular, set out detailed requirements for the second line of defence (the independent risk management and compliance function) and the third line of defence (the internal audit function).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_98665: The guidelines are based on an earlier set of guidelines on internal governance and in particular add additional requirements that aim to foster a sound risk culture implemented by the management body, to strengthen the management body's oversight of the institution's activities and to strengthen the risk management frameworks of institutions. Additional guidelines have been provided to further increase the transparency of institutions' offshore activities and to ensure the consideration of risks within institutions' change processes.

The existing guidelines on internal governance, published on 27 September 2011, will be repealed at the same time. On the same date, the EBA and ESMA joint guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders will come into force.

PARAGRAPH_98676: Background and rationale

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_98677: 1. Trust in the reliability of the financial system is crucial for its proper functioning and a prerequisite if it is to contribute to the economy as a whole. Consequently, effective internal governance arrangements are fundamental if institutions individually and the banking system they form are to operate well.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_98678: 2. In recent years, internal governance issues have received increased attention from various international bodies. Their main aim has been to correct institutions' weak or superficial internal governance practices, as identified during the financial crisis. These faulty practices, while not a direct trigger for the financial crisis, were closely associated with it and were questionable. In addition, recently, there has been a greater focus on conduct-related shortcomings and activities in offshore financial centres.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_98679: 3. In some cases, at the time of the financial crisis the absence of effective checks and balances within institutions resulted in a lack of effective oversight of management decision-making, which led to short-term oriented and excessively risky management strategies. Weak oversight by the management body in its supervisory function has been identified as a contributing factor. The management body, both in its management function and, in particular, in its supervisory function, might not have understood the complexity of the business and the risks involved, consequently failing to identify and constrain excessive risk- taking in an effective manner.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_98680: 4. Internal governance frameworks, including internal control mechanisms and risk management, were often not sufficiently integrated within institutions or groups. There was a lack of a uniform methodology and terminology, so that a holistic view of all risks did not exist. Internal control functions often lacked appropriate resources, status and/or expertise.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_98681: 5. Conversely, sound internal governance practices helped some institutions to manage the financial crisis significantly better than others. These practices included the setting of an appropriate risk strategy and appropriate risk appetite levels, a holistic risk management framework and effective reporting lines to the management body.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_98682: 6. Against this background, there is a clear need to address the potentially detrimental effects of poorly designed internal governance arrangements on the sound management of risk, to ensure effective oversight by the management body, in particular in its supervisory function, to promote a sound risk culture at all levels of institutions and to enable competent authorities to supervise and monitor the adequacy of internal governance arrangements.

PARAGRAPH_98688: 7. To further harmonise institutions' internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms within the EU, the EBA is mandated by Article 74 of Directive 2013/36/EU to develop guidelines in this area.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_98689: 8. Article 74 of Directive 2013/36/EU requires institutions to have robust governance arrangements, including a clear organisational structure with well-defined, transparent and consistent lines of responsibility.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_98690: 9. Article 76 of Directive 2013/36/EU sets out requirements for the involvement of the management body in risk management, the setting up of a risk committee for significant institutions, and the tasks and organisation of the risk management function. In addition, this Article establishes 'that the head of the risk management function shall be an independent senior management with distinct responsibility for the risk management function'. To reflect the wording of the Directive, the revised guidelines refer, regarding the second line of defence, to the '(independent) risk management function', while the previous guidelines used the term '(independent) risk control function'. However, it should be remembered that business lines or units, as the first line of defence, have a material role in ensuring robust risk management and compliance within an institution.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_98691: 10. Article 88 of Directive 2013/36/EU sets out the responsibilities of the management body regarding governance arrangements and the obligation to set up a nomination committee for significant institutions.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_98692: 11. Under Article 109(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU, competent authorities must require institutions to meet the obligations set out in Articles 74 to 96 of that Directive on an individual basis, unless competent authorities make use of the derogations as defined in Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and/or waivers for institutions permanently affiliated to a central body in compliance with Article 21 of Directive 2013/36/EU.

PARAGRAPH_98693: 12. Article 109(2) of Directive 2013/36/EU requires parent undertakings and subsidiaries subject to this Directive to meet the governance requirements also on a consolidated or sub- consolidated basis, to ensure that their arrangements, processes and mechanisms are consistent and well-integrated and that any data and information relevant to the purpose of supervision can be produced. In particular, it should be ensured that parent undertakings and subsidiaries subject to this Directive implement such arrangements, processes and mechanisms in their subsidiaries not subject to this Directive. These arrangements, processes and mechanisms must also be consistent and well-integrated and those subsidiaries not subject to this Directive must also be able to produce any data and information relevant to the purpose of supervision.

PARAGRAPH_98700: 14. Under Article 123(2) of Directive 2013/36/EU, competent authorities must require institutions to have in place adequate risk management processes and internal control mechanisms, including sound reporting and accounting procedures in order to identify, measure, monitor and control transactions with their parent mixed-activity holding company and its subsidiaries appropriately.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_98701: 15. In line with Article 47 of Directive 2013/36/EU, branches in a Member State of credit institutions authorised in a third country should be subject to equivalent requirements to those applicable to institutions within the Member State where the branch is located, taking into account regarding internal governance arrangements that the branch does not have a management body but persons who are responsible for effectively directing the business.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_98702: 16. The guidelines should be read in conjunction with and without prejudice to the guidelines on sound remuneration policies (EBA/GL/2015/22) and the joint guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders. The existing guidelines on internal governance, published on 27 September 2011, will be repealed when the new guidelines enter into force.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_98703: 17. These guidelines should be read in conjunction with other relevant EBA products, including the CEBS guidelines on outsourcing arrangements and the EBA guidelines on the supervisory review process and the EBA guidelines on disclosures.

PARAGRAPH_98705: 18. Internal governance includes all standards and principles concerned with setting an institution's objectives, strategies and risk management framework; how its business is organised; how responsibilities and authority are defined and clearly allocated; how reporting lines are set up and what information they convey; and how the internal control framework is organised and implemented, including accounting procedures and remuneration policies. Internal governance also encompasses sound information technology systems, outsourcing arrangements and business continuity management.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_98706: 19. Directive 2013/36/EU sets out requirements aimed at remedying weaknesses that were identified during the financial crisis regarding internal governance arrangements and in particular the sound management and oversight of risks. Identified weaknesses included in particular a lack of effective oversight by the management body, in particular in its supervisory function, limited accessability of the supervisory function and shortcomings regarding the authority, stature and resources of the risk management function.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:9]
PARAGRAPH_98711: 20. In addition, it is also necessary to take into account developments in this area since the publication of the EBA guidelines on internal governance in 2011, such as the updated OECD principles of corporate governance1 and the revised corporate governance principles for banks published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)2. The guidelines align the terminology used regarding risk appetite and risk tolerance with the EBA guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) (EBA/GL/2014/13) and also with the revised BCBS principles; they use the term 'risk appetite' to refer to the aggregate level of risk and the types of risk an institution is willing to assume, while 'risk capacity' is the maximum amount of risk an institution is able to assume.

PARAGRAPH_98712: 21. The guidelines are intended to apply to all existing board structures without interfering with the general allocation of competences in accordance with national company law or advocating any particular structure. Accordingly, they should be applied irrespective of the board structure used (a unitary and/or a dual board structure and/or another structure) across Member States. The management body, as defined in points (7) and (8) of Article 3(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU, should be understood as having management (executive) and supervisory (non-executive) functions.

PARAGRAPH_98713: 22. The terms 'management body in its management function' and 'management body in its supervisory function' are used throughout these guidelines without referring to any specific governance structure, and references to the management (executive) or supervisory (non- executive) function should be understood as applying to the bodies or members of the management body responsible for that function in accordance with national law.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:9]
PARAGRAPH_98714: 23. In Member States where the management body delegates, partially or fully, the executive function to a person or an internal executive body (e.g. a chief executive officer (CEO), management team or executive committee), the persons who perform those executive functions on the basis of that delegation should be understood as constituting the management function of the management body. For the purposes of these guidelines, any reference to the management body in its management function should be understood as including also the members of the executive body or the CEO, as defined in these guidelines, even if they have not been proposed or appointed as formal members of the institution's governing body or bodies under national law.

PARAGRAPH_98727: 29. The business lines, as the first line of defence, take risks and are responsible for their operational management directly and on a permanent basis. For that purpose, business lines should have appropriate processes and controls in place that aim to ensure that risks are identified, analysed, measured, monitored, managed, reported and kept within the limits of the institution's risk appetite and that the business activities are in compliance with external and internal requirements.

The risk management function (referred to in the previous guidelines as the 'risk control function') facilitates the implementation of a sound risk management framework throughout the institution and has responsibility for further identifying, monitoring, analysing, measuring, managing and reporting on risks and forming a holistic view on all risks on an individual and consolidated basis. It challenges and assists in the implementation of risk management measures by the business lines in order to ensure that the process and controls in place at the first line of defence are properly designed and effective. The compliance function monitors compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and internal policies, provides advice on compliance to the management body and other

The independent internal audit function, as the third line of defence, conducts risk-based and general audits and reviews the internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms to ascertain that they are sound and effective, implemented and consistently applied. The internal audit function is in charge also of the independent review of the first two lines of defence.

PARAGRAPH_98736: 32. To ensure their proper functioning, all internal control functions need to be independent of the business they control, have the appropriate financial and human resources to perform their tasks, and report directly to the management body.

PARAGRAPH_98739: 35. The guidelines aim to establish a sound risk culture in institutions. Risks should be taken within a well-defined framework in line with the institution's risk strategy and appetite. This includes the establishment of and ensuring compliance with a system of limits and controls. Risks within new products and business areas, but also risks that may result from changes to institutions' products, processes and systems, are to be duly identified, assessed, appropriately managed and monitored. The risk management function and compliance function should be involved in the establishment of the framework and the approval of such changes to ensure that all material risks are taken into account and that the institution complies with all internal and external requirements.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:34]
PARAGRAPH_99069: 91. The outsourcing policy should consider the impact of outsourcing on an institution's business and the risks it faces (such as operational risks, including legal and IT risks; reputational risks; and concentration risks). The policy should include the reporting and monitoring arrangements to be implemented from inception to the end of an outsourcing agreement (including drawing up the business case for outsourcing, entering into an outsourcing contract, the implementation of the contract to its expiry, contingency plans and exit strategies). An institution remains fully responsible for all outsourced services and activities and management decisions arising from them. Accordingly, the outsourcing policy should make it clear that outsourcing does not relieve the institution of its regulatory obligations and its responsibilities to its customers.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:34]
PARAGRAPH_99070: 92. The policy should state that outsourcing arrangements should not hinder effective on-site or off-site supervision of the institution and should not contravene any supervisory restrictions on services and activities. The policy should also cover intragroup outsourcing (i.e. services provided by a separate legal entity within an institution's group) and take into account any specific group circumstances.

The behaviour of its members should reflect the values being espoused. Institutions' management, including key function holders, should contribute to the internal communication of core values and expectations to staff. Staff should act in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations and promptly escalate observed non-compliance within or outside the institution (e.g. to the competent authority through a whistleblowing process). The management body should on an ongoing basis promote, monitor and assess the risk culture of the institution; consider the impact of the risk culture on the financial stability, risk profile and robust governance of the institution; and make changes where necessary.

PARAGRAPH_99093: 99. The management body should develop, adopt, adhere to and promote high ethical and professional standards, taking into account the specific needs and characteristics of the institution, and should ensure the implementation of such standards (through a code of conduct or similar instrument). It should also oversee adherence to these standards by staff. Where applicable, the management body may adopt and implement the institution's group- wide standards or common standards released by associations or other relevant organisations.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:36]
PARAGRAPH_99094: 100. The implemented standards should aim to reduce the risks to which the institution is exposed, in particular operational and reputational risks, which can have a considerable adverse impact on an institution's profitability and sustainability through fines, litigation costs, restrictions imposed by competent authorities, other financial and criminal penalties, and the loss of brand value and consumer confidence.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:36]

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:42] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_99184: 126. Institutions should develop and maintain a culture that encourages a positive attitude towards risk control and compliance within the institution and a robust and comprehensive internal control framework. Under this framework, institutions' business lines should be responsible for managing the risks they incur in conducting their activities and should have controls in place that aim to ensure compliance with internal and external requirements. As part of this framework, institutions should have internal control functions with appropriate and sufficient authority, stature and access to the management body to fulfil their mission, and a risk management framework.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:42] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_99185: 127. The internal control framework of the institution concerned should be adapted on an individual basis to the specificity of its business, its complexity and the associated risks, taking into account the group context. The institutions concerned must organise the exchange of the information necessary in a manner that ensures that each management body, business line and internal unit, including each internal control function, is able to carry out its duties. This means, for example, a necessary exchange of adequate information between the business lines and the compliance function at the group level and between the heads of the internal control functions at the group level and the management body of the institution.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:44]
PARAGRAPH_99209: 136. As part of the overall internal control framework, institutions should have a holistic institution-wide risk management framework extending across all its business lines and internal units, including internal control functions, recognising fully the economic substance of all its risk exposures. The risk management framework should enable the institution to make fully informed decisions on risk-taking. The risk management framework should encompass on- and off-balance-sheet risks as well as actual risks and future risks that the institution may be exposed to. Risks should be evaluated from the bottom up and from the top down, within and across business lines, using consistent terminology and compatible methodologies throughout the institution and at consolidated or sub-consolidated level. All relevant risks should be encompassed in the risk management framework with appropriate consideration of both financial and non-financial risks, including credit, market, liquidity, concentration, operational, IT, reputational, legal, conduct, compliance and strategic risks.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:44]
PARAGRAPH_99210: 137. An institution's risk management framework should include policies, procedures, risk limits and risk controls ensuring adequate, timely and continuous identification, measurement or assessment, monitoring, management, mitigation and reporting of the risks at the business line, institution and consolidated or sub-consolidated levels.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:44] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_99211: 138. An institution's risk management framework should provide specific guidance on the implementation of its strategies. This guidance should, where appropriate, establish and maintain internal limits consistent with the institution's risk appetite and commensurate with its sound operation, financial strength, capital base and strategic goals. An institution's risk profile should be kept within these established limits. The risk management framework should ensure that, whenever breaches of risk limits occur, there is a defined process to escalate and address them with an appropriate follow-up procedure.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:44]
PARAGRAPH_99212: 139. The risk management framework should be subject to independent internal review, e.g. performed by the internal audit function, and reassessed regularly against the institution's risk appetite, taking into account information from the risk management function and, where established, the risk committee. Factors that should be considered include internal and external developments, including balance-sheet and revenue changes; any increase in the complexity of the institution's business, risk profile or operating structure; geographic expansion; mergers and acquisitions; and the introduction of new products or business lines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:44]
PARAGRAPH_99213: 140. When identifying and measuring or assessing risks, an institution should develop appropriate methodologies including both forward-looking and backward-looking tools. The methodologies should allow for the aggregation of risk exposures across business lines and support the identification of risk concentrations. The tools should include the assessment of the actual risk profile against the institution's risk appetite, as well as the identification and assessment of potential and stressed risk exposures under a range of assumed adverse circumstances against the institution's risk capacity. The tools should provide information on

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:45]
PARAGRAPH_99219: 141. Institutions should take into consideration that the results of quantitative assessment methodologies, including stress testing, are highly dependent on the limitations and assumptions of the models (including the severity and duration of the shock and the underlying risks). For example, models showing very high returns on economic capital may result from a weakness in the models (e.g. the exclusion of some relevant risks) rather than a superior strategy or excellent execution of a strategy on the part of the institution. The determination of the level of risk taken should not therefore be based only on quantitative information or model outputs; it should also comprise a qualitative approach (including expert judgement and critical analysis). Relevant macroeconomic environmental trends and data should be explicitly addressed to identify their potential impact on exposures and portfolios.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:45] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_99220: 142. The ultimate responsibility for risk assessment lies solely with the institution, which, accordingly, should evaluate its risks critically and should not rely exclusively on external assessments. For example, an institution should validate a purchased risk model and calibrate it to its own individual circumstances to ensure that the model accurately and comprehensively captures and analyses the risk.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:45]
PARAGRAPH_99221: 143. Institutions should be fully aware of the limitations of models and metrics and use not only quantitative but also qualitative risk assessment tools (including expert judgement and critical analysis).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:45]
PARAGRAPH_99222: 144. In addition to the institutions' own assessments, institutions may use external risk assessments (including external credit ratings or externally purchased risk models). Institutions should be fully aware of the exact scope of such assessments and their limitations.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:45]
PARAGRAPH_99223: 145. Regular and transparent reporting mechanisms should be established so that the management body, its risk committee, where established, and all relevant units in an institution are provided with reports in a timely, accurate, concise, understandable and meaningful manner and can share relevant information about the identification, measurement or assessment, monitoring and management of risks. The reporting framework should be well defined and documented.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:45]
PARAGRAPH_99224: 146. Effective communication and awareness regarding risks and the risk strategy is crucial for the whole risk management process, including the review and decision-making processes, and helps prevent decisions that may unknowingly increase risk. Effective risk reporting involves sound internal consideration and communication of risk strategy and relevant risk data (e.g. exposures and key risk indicators), both horizontally across the institution and up and down the management chain.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:46] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_99229: 147. An institution should have in place a well-documented new product approval policy (NPAP), approved by the management body, that addresses the development of new markets, products and services, and significant changes to existing ones, as well as exceptional transactions. The policy should in addition encompass material changes to related processes (e.g. new outsourcing arrangements) and systems (e.g. IT change processes). The NPAP should ensure that approved products and changes are consistent with the risk strategy and risk appetite of the institution and the corresponding limits, or that necessary revisions are made.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:46]
PARAGRAPH_99230: 148. Material changes or exceptional transactions may include mergers and acquisitions, including the potential consequences of conducting insufficient due diligence that fails to identify post-merger risks and liabilities; setting up structures (e.g. new subsidiaries or single purpose vehicles; new products; changes to systems or the risk management framework or procedures; and changes to the institution's organisation.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:46]

PARAGRAPH_99232: 150. An institution's NPAP should cover every consideration to be taken into account before deciding to enter new markets, deal in new products, launch a new service, or make significant changes to existing products or services.

Heads of internal control functions should be established at an adequate hierarchical level that provides the head of the control function with the appropriate authority and stature needed to fulfil his or her responsibilities. Notwithstanding the overall responsibility of the management body, heads of internal control functions should be independent of the business lines or units they control. To this end, the heads of the risk management, compliance and internal audit functions should report and be directly accountable to the management body, and their performance should be reviewed by the management body.

PARAGRAPH_99348: 208. Institutions should establish a sound business continuity management plan to ensure their ability to operate on an ongoing basis and to limit losses in the event of severe business disruption.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:55]
PARAGRAPH_99350: 210. An institution's business relies on several critical resources (e.g. IT systems including cloud services, communication systems and buildings). The purpose of business continuity management is to reduce the operational, financial, legal, reputational and other material consequences arising from a disaster or extended interruption to these resources and consequent disruption to the institution's ordinary business procedures. Other risk management measures might be intended to reduce the probability of such incidents or to transfer their financial impact to third parties (e.g. through insurance).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:55] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_99351: 211. In order to establish a sound business continuity management plan, an institution should carefully analyse its exposure to severe business disruptions and assess (quantitatively and qualitatively) their potential impact, using internal and/or external data and scenario analysis. This analysis should cover all business lines and internal units, including the RMF, and should take into account their interdependency. The results of the analysis should contribute to defining the institution's recovery priorities and objectives.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:55]
PARAGRAPH_99352: 212. On the basis of the abovementioned analysis, an institution should put in place:

PARAGRAPH_99354: b. recovery plans for critical resources to enable the institution to return to ordinary business procedures in an appropriate timeframe. Any residual risk from potential business disruptions should be consistent with the institution's risk appetite.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:55]
PARAGRAPH_99355: 213. Contingency, business continuity and recovery plans should be documented and carefully implemented. The documentation should be available within the business lines, internal units and RMF, and should be stored on systems that are physically separated and readily accessible in case of contingency. Appropriate training should be provided. Plans should be regularly tested and updated. Any challenges or failures occurring in the tests should be documented and analysed, with the plans reviewed accordingly.

Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) (EBA Regulation) provides that the EBA should carry out an analysis of 'the potential related costs and benefits' of any guidelines it develops.

PARAGRAPH_99437: 2. Trust in the reliability of the financial system is crucial for its proper functioning and a prerequisite if it is to contribute to the economy as a whole. Consequently, effective internal governance arrangements are fundamental if institutions individually and the banking system they form are to operate well.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:59]
PARAGRAPH_99438: 3. Weaknesses in corporate governance in a number of institutions have contributed to excessive and imprudent risk-taking in the financial sector, which has led to the failure of individual institutions and systemic problems in Member States and globally. The very general provisions on governance of institutions and the non-binding nature of a substantial part of the corporate governance framework, based essentially on voluntary codes of conduct, did not sufficiently facilitate the effective implementation of sound corporate governance practices by institutions. In some cases, the absence of effective checks and balances within institutions resulted in a lack of effective oversight of management decision-making, which exacerbated short-term and excessively risky management strategies.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:59] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_99439: 4. In order to address the potentially detrimental effect of poorly designed corporate governance arrangements on the sound management of risk, requirements to ensure effective oversight by the management body, promote a sound risk culture at all levels of credit institutions and investment firms, and enable competent authorities to monitor the adequacy of internal governance arrangements are needed.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:60]
PARAGRAPH_99446: 6. The EBA has updated the previously issued EBA guidelines on internal governance. The underlying reasons are mainly additions made in Directive 2013/36/EU to the existing regulatory framework. The guidelines were also restructured to increase their clarity and their consistency with other guidelines issued by the EBA in the meantime, in particular with regard to the reinforcement of the requirements regarding risk oversight by the management body and the risk management function, the application of the internal governance arrangements at group level and more precise criteria regarding the application of the proportionality principle.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:60]
PARAGRAPH_99447: 7. The governance requirements should be applied on a consolidated basis, that is at the levels of the group, parent undertakings and subsidiaries, including branches and subsidiaries established in third countries and subsidiaries to which Directive 2013/36/EU does not directly apply on an individual level.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:60]
PARAGRAPH_99448: 8. The implementation of internal governance arrangements should reflect differences between types of institutions in a proportionate manner, taking into account their size and internal organisation and the nature, scope and complexity of their activities.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:60]
PARAGRAPH_99449: 9. In order to ensure a well-functioning internal market, transparent, predictable and harmonised supervisory practices and decisions are necessary for conducting business. The EBA should therefore seek to further harmonise supervisory practices.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:60]
PARAGRAPH_99450: 10. The EBA aims for the maximum possible harmonisation as a means to achieve a level playing field, prevent regulatory arbitrage opportunities, increase supervisory convergence and achieve legal certainty. In addition, the development of common procedures and practices is expected to reduce the compliance burden on institutions and contribute to efficient and effective cooperation among competent authorities.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:60]
PARAGRAPH_99451: 11. The EBA has updated the aforementioned guidelines on internal governance in line with the mandate given under Article 74 of Directive 2013/36/EU and based on the reinforced internal governance requirements introduced under this Directive to achieve a higher level of harmonisation, to ensure effective oversight by the management body and to promote a sound risk culture at all levels of credit institutions and investment firms.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:60]
PARAGRAPH_99452: 12. In particular, the guidelines specify:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:61]
PARAGRAPH_99462: 13. The current EU legislative framework for institutions' internal governance consists mainly of Directive 2013/36/EU; the EBA guidelines on internal governance, published in 2011; the EBA guidelines for common procedures and methodologies for the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP); the EBA guidelines on sound remuneration policies; and the EBA guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:61]
PARAGRAPH_99463: 14. The impact assessment covers guidelines developed to ensure the harmonised application of additional governance requirements introduced by Directive 2013/36/EU and areas where the policy has changed. Areas that have not changed in substance and the underlying changes introduced by the Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 have not been assessed.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:61]
PARAGRAPH_99465: 15. The following sets of policy options were considered.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:61]
PARAGRAPH_99466: Option 1: Scope of the guidelines:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:61]
PARAGRAPH_99467: 16. Option A: providing guidelines on all aspects of internal governance arrangements including the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body, remuneration and disclosures.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:61]
PARAGRAPH_99468: 17. Option B: providing guidelines only on the aspects that have not been dealt with in other EBA products.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:61]
PARAGRAPH_99469: 18. Option A might appear to be more efficient for the addressees, as all the guidelines on this particular area would be accessible in a single document. The costs of implementing a single set of guidelines and separate sets of guidelines would be the same.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:61]

PARAGRAPH_99478: 22. Option B: reinforcement of the involvement of the management body regarding risk oversight by strengthening its duties and responsibilities, and distinguishing between the management body in its supervisory function and in its management function. In particular, it should be established that the management body in its supervisory function should monitor that the strategic objectives, the organisational structure, and the risk strategy and policy, as well as other policies such as remuneration and disclosure obligations, are implemented consistently. The management body in its management function should implement the strategies set by the management body and discuss regularly the implementation and appropriateness of those strategies with the management body in its supervisory function.

While some additional guidelines would be provided regarding the responsibilities of the management body, it is not expected that this would increase the costs of the governance arrangements already implemented within institutions or of supervision by competent authorities. Assessing and increasing the qualifications and the available resources of members of the management body, particularly regarding risk management, would tigger some costs. The costs would depend on the size and complexity of the institution.

PARAGRAPH_99499: 37. Option C would create consistency between the internal control functions. While one might argue that this would cause additional costs, those costs are needed to establish a sound internal control framework and ensure the independence of the internal control functions. This is already required by existing regulations. However, stronger internal functions within institutions might be more costly in terms of staff costs or reorganisation; on the other hand, institutions would also benefit from the improved framework, which would lead to a better alignment of risk profile with risk appetite as set by the management body.

PARAGRAPH_99506: 39. Respondents to the public consultation found it difficult to assess the costs of the implementation work needed under the updated guidelines. The burden would be greater if all the guidelines needed to be applied on an individual level by all subsidiaries. A few respondents stressed that the development of ethical standards for external service providers would create additional costs. The guidelines might lead to a need for more staff for governance arrangements. Respondents pointed out the effect on the level playing field in relation to third countries.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_99507: 40. While the guidelines are applicable to all institutions, regarding other subsidiaries they apply only on a consolidated or sub-consolidated basis and not on an individual level. Directive 2013/36/EU is to be applied to all subsidiaries on a consolidated basis and therefore related burdens are not incurred by implementing the guidelines. Sound ethical standards are key to protecting an institution's reputation. This holds true also where services are provided by external sources. The guidelines were adjusted and require institutions to take into account the ethical standards in place at service providers when selecting them. Overall, the initial assessment has not changed; in particular, the requirements regarding the independence of members of the management body and the composition of committees have been made lighter after taking into account the responses to the public consultation.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_99508: 41. Overall, the guidelines, compared with the baseline scenario, will create very low additional recurring costs for institutions, mainly driven by reorganising their internal control frameworks. In addition, the minor increase in costs will be compensated for by the adoption of a more proportionate approach with clear criteria and by the additional benefits in terms of effective and sound internal governance arrangements. The implementation of the guidelines will improve internal governance within institutions and therefore reduce their vulnerability. Sound internal governance and conduct of business helps to build up trust in the banking system.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_99509: 42. The implementation of the guidelines by competent authorities will trigger low one-off costs to change existing rules/methodologies/manuals and to inform staff members and the sector regarding those changes.

PARAGRAPH_99521: Summary of key issues and the EBA's responses

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:65]
PARAGRAPH_99522: A key issue raised by many respondents is the applicability of the guidelines to different governance structures. Respondents were of the view that some provisions of the guidelines are not enforceable in or are not compatible with some governance structures adopted in Member States. For instance, in one-tier structures institutions have a unitary and inseparable body through which both management and supervisory functions are performed and where all members have the same responsibilities. Under some company laws, the body appointed by shareholders does not have executive functions and therefore some respondents felt that no requirements should be addressed to the management body in its management function; rather, they should be addressed to the senior management. A few respondents identified particular aspects that they deemed inappropriate for two-tier structures and for particular business models and/or governance systems, such as public or cooperative institutions. Overall, respondents advocated ensuring that the EBA guidelines are compatible with all governance models. In this context, some respondents believed that the definitions of the management body in its different functions should be clarified and that the notion of senior management should be used in the guidelines; in particular, 'senior management' should be included in the 'management body in its management function'. In addition, it was argued that the notion of key function holders should not be part of the guidelines, as it is not included in Directive 2013/36/EU.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:65]
PARAGRAPH_99523: Regarding the establishment of committees, many respondents deemed the guidelines to be too detailed, endangering the desirable flexibility granted under national laws. A few respondents pointed out that there could be unintended consequences, such as the building of inefficient and too large boards.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:66]
PARAGRAPH_99528: Another key issue identified concerns the scope and the level of application of the guidelines. First, respondents asked for confirmation that the guidelines do not apply to subsidiaries that are themselves not subject to Directive 2013/36/EU on a solo basis, but only on a consolidated basis. The situation of investment firms to which Directive 2004/39/EC, but not Directive 2013/36/EU applies should also be clarified. Second, some respondents asked for the group context to be better taken into account and suggested, in line with the principle of proportionality, applying lighter requirements to subsidiaries or allowing exclusions, arguing that subsidiaries should be allowed to rely on the group with regard to several matters (e.g. reporting, the code of conduct, the description of the operational structure, the internal control framework). It was argued that, with the same objective of decreasing the administrative and compliance burden, it should be made clear that proportionality applies to all the requirements of the guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:66]
PARAGRAPH_99529: Respondents found that parts of the guidelines (the references to the audit committee, the requirements on the composition of committees and the requirement to have independent members on the risk and nomination committees, the guidelines on reporting breaches to competent authorities, etc.) lacked a solid legal basis, because they went beyond what Directive 2013/36/EU explicitly requires. Respondents also suggested that the definition of 'independence' should be left to national law.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:66]
PARAGRAPH_99530: Respondents recommended that the three lines of defence model should be better defined and explained, while ensuring that the responsibilities of the first line are clearly set out.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:66]
PARAGRAPH_99531: The EBA has analysed and considered all the responses to the public consultation. The guidelines have been revised so that they can be applied to all possible governance structures. It is neither the intention to require institutions to change their governance structure, nor to alter the assignment of responsibilities as set out in national law. The guidelines clarify the meaning of 'management body' provided in Directive 2013/36/EU. They also clarify that any reference to the management body should be understood as including not only the members of the body appointed under national law but also the persons directing the business (e.g. the CEO or executive committee). The guidelines do not use the term 'senior management', as the definition is not precise enough and has been implemented by Member States in different ways. Using the concept of senior management in the guidelines would not lead to the appropriate level of harmonisation. The requirements on board committees have been revised to better reflect the principle of proportionality and other international standards.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:66] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_99532: Article 109 of Directive 2013/36/EU determines how the governance requirements should be applied. Institutions that are subject to that Directive have to apply the requirements on an individual basis. Regarding subsidiaries that are not subject to Directive 2013/36/EU, including MiFID firms not subject to Directive 2013/36/EU, the requirements are applied in a group context on a consolidated or sub-consolidated basis. The principle of proportionality should ensure the appropriate application of the requirements on all levels. Institutions are expected to adopt and implement group policies and, naturally, with regard to the performance of tasks, governance arrangements existing within the group can be relied on, while the management body of an institution has overall responsibility for that institution and its governance arrangements.

PARAGRAPH_99537: In accordance with Article 16 of the EBA Regulation, the EBA has the power to issue guidelines in the area of its competence. The area of governance, including the supervision of institutions' governance arrangements, is clearly included in this area (e.g. Article 74 of Directive 2013/36/EU). It is not necessary for certain concepts to be explicitly mentioned in the Directive in relation to the issuing of guidelines by the EBA. The EBA is not restricted to issuing guidelines based on an explicit mandate from the co-legislators. The concepts of key function holders, codes of conduct, independent directors, etc., are clearly linked to institutions' governance arrangements and therefore the EBA has the power to issue guidelines on these topics.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:67]
PARAGRAPH_99538: The guidelines are compatible with the three lines of defence model and it has been clarified that the business units (the first line of defence) are part of this model. However, the guidelines focus in particular on the responsibilities of the management body and the second line of defence. It was not deemed necessary to refer explicitly in the guidelines to the three lines of defence model; as the purpose of the guidelines is to specify regulatory requirements that are linked to certain functions, such explanatory text was not required. The structure of the guidelines has been changed to better differentiate between the internal control framework, in which all three lines of defence participate, and the specific requirements in relation to the second line of defence.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:67]
PARAGRAPH_99539: The principle of proportionality, a principle that applies to all EU legislation, applies to the guidelines. This means that the guidelines are to be applied taking into account the size of the institution and the nature, scale and complexity of its activities.

With regard to competent authorities, guidelines are subject to a comply or explain approach, i.e. if part of the guidelines would contradict national law the competent authority has the option to not comply with the relevant part of the guidelines. Institutions should make every effort to comply with the guidelines. Institutions must comply with applicable law. Preserving in all cases existing national law would limit future harmonisation.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:72] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_99626: With regard to cases where the 'management body' is mentioned without specifying whether in its management or supervisory function, some respondents suggest clarifying that this means the management body in its management function; others suggest that the guidelines should expressly provide that national corporate law will determine if the requirement will apply to the management body in its management or in its supervisory function. Some respondents suggest more clearly defining, including in the definitions section, the notion of ‘management body'. With regard to its composition, it should be clarified that the management body must include not only the board of directors but also the CEO, the members of the executive committees, and the general manager or other senior managers, who will take responsibility for the executive management of the bank even if they are not part of the board.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:72]
PARAGRAPH_99627: The responsibilities of the management body, including in its management (executive) and supervisory (non-executive) functions, differ depending on the governance structure and national company law. Further specification in the guidelines is often not possible, as the guidelines do not intend to interfere with the responsibilities assigned under national company law. The responsibility is to be assigned to the responsible function within the management body under national law. In some cases, responsibilities may even be with the shareholders or owners directly. The definition of 'management body' in Article 3(7) of Directive 2013/36/EU indeed includes not only the body or bodies appointed in accordance with national law but also the persons who effectively direct the business of the institution. The management body is therefore sometimes broader than the governance body or bodies under national law, and always includes the persons who direct the business (e.g. the CEO, the executive committee or similar staff) in cases where they are not part of the governance body or bodies appointed by shareholders. The guidelines have been clarified accordingly.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:74] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_99671: Article 16 of the EBA Regulation lays down the general competence to issue guidelines with a view to establishing consistent, efficient and effective supervisory practices within the European System of Financial Supervision and ensuring the common, uniform and consistent application of Union law. However, the EBA may only issue guidelines within its scope of action, which is defined in Article 1(2) and (3) of the EBA Regulation. In accordance with Article 1(2), the limitation of power is clearly marked: the EBA must act only within the scope of the listed EU directives/regulations and of any further legally binding Union act that confers tasks on the EBA. Directive 2013/36/EU is one of the directives listed and internal governance is expressly covered in Article 74 of the CRD. Moreover, Article 74(3) of Directive 2013/36/EU expressly mandates the EBA to issue guidelines on the governance arrangements, processes and internal control mechanisms referred to in Article 74(1). In addition, corporate governance is expressly mentioned in Article 1(3) of the EBA Regulation among the matters on which the EBA is allowed to act in the field of the activities of credit institutions and investment firms. Ensuring the suitability of key function holders of credit institutions and their role in institutions is an essential part of the internal governance arrangements for the prudent management of an institution. Moreover, in accordance with Article 98(7) of the CRD IV, such governance arrangements must be expressly included in the review and evaluation to be conducted by competent authorities.

PARAGRAPH_99689: Some respondents suggest better reconciling this definition with the fact that members of the management body always have to pursue the benefit of the entity first, but typically also have to consider the interests of all shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. Otherwise, it could lead to the unacceptable consequence that shareholder representatives on the supervisory board would have to abstain from their voting right when decisions regarding the annual accounts and the possible dividends had to be made.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:77]
PARAGRAPH_99732: Some respondents observe that supervision seems to be entrusted to non-executive members only, with no chance for the executive members of the management body to take part in it. Responsibility for strategic supervision is with the board as a whole and not with individual non-executive members. Some other respondents suggest that the management body in its supervisory function should not be understood in all cases as a mere monitoring and overseeing body. The focus on board monitoring should be balanced by a correspondent emphasis on the strategic function of the board, consisting in developing the organisation and its strategy. It is suggested that the guidelines be more balanced on this topic.

PARAGRAPH_99773: Some respondents comment that the chair of the management body should be both independent and a non-executive member. Some respondents suggest clarifying if the guidance on the chair is applicable to the management body in its management or supervisory function (or both). Some respondents suggest that the guidelines should put greater emphasis on the relevance of the personal attitudes of the chair.

PARAGRAPH_99774: The EBA guidelines require, in line with the BCBS principles, that the chair is independent or a non-executive-member. In addition, Directive 2013/36/EU and the guidelines allow, in exceptional cases with the approval of the competent authority, that the chair can be the same person as the CEO. The chair is, in line with Article 88 of the Directive, the chair of the supervisory function. In a unitary board system, the differentiation suggested is not possible. When reading the guidelines, applicable company law has to be taken into account. The assessment of the chair's skills is part of the assessment of his or her suitability, which needs to take into account the position of a member of the management body.

Some respondents deem that the requirements on the different committees are too detailed and ask for a more flexible approach. Some respondents observe that some national corporate laws do not allow the issues to be dealt with by the specialised committees (compliance, risk management, internal control, reporting) to be delegated by the board; consequently, such issues remain competences of the board.

Having at least some independent members of the management body in its supervisory function is required for all significant institutions and listed institutions, including subsidiaries, ensuring that the interests of all stakeholders are taken into account. Other institutions should have at least one idependent director, unless they are fully owned subsidiaries within a group.The necessary harmonisation of criteria to assess the independence of a member is not possible in the absence of requirements at the European Union level.

In order to ensure more flexibility, some respondents suggest adding the following: 'Where the member is not considered independent, the institutions can prove the independence of a member and/or decide on measures to mitigate possible conflicts of interest so that the member is independent afterwards. For example, the member should abstain from voting on any matter where a conflict of interest exists. This process and decisions should be documented.'

PARAGRAPH_99850: Some of the respondents do not agree on requiring appropriate 'professional' experience of the members of the risk and nomination committees, deeming that the adjective 'professional' suggests that all members must be able to look back on a career as a risk manager. This requirement does not match those of Article 76(3) of CRD IV. That provision does not require any experience at all, but only knowledge, skills and expertise. Some respondents observe that requiring members of the committees to have such knowledge, skills and experience both individually and collectively would be particularly challenging in a two-tier system, where a very different set of individuals performs the

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:84]
PARAGRAPH_99864: Independent members of the management body in its
management function should always have an active role in committees. In G-SIIs and O-SIIs, the nomination committee should include a majority of members who are independent and should be chaired by an independent member. In other isignificant nstitutions, the nomination committee should include a sufficient number of members who are independent; having a chair of the nomination committee who is independent is considered a good practice in all significant institutions that have set up such a committee. In G-SIIs and O-SIIs, the risk committee should include a majority of members who are independent. In other significant institutions, the risk committee should include a sufficient number of members who are independent. In G-SIIs and O-SIIs, the chair of the risk committee should be an independent, non-executive member. In other significant institutions, the risk committee should be chaired, where possible, by an independent, non-executive member. In all institutions the chair of the risk committee should be neither the chair of the management body nor the chair of any other committee. The management body and its committees need to take into account the interests of all stakeholders and not only of the shareholders.

PARAGRAPH_99866: - Some deem that this requirement goes far beyond BCBS principles on corporate governance. The principle of proportionality has to be applied, as the BCBS principles are generally applied to G-SIIs. - Some highlight the impact that this requirement would have on group structures: it would mean that, for example, the CFO of an industrial enterprise that is the parent company of a credit institution would no longer be able to chair the risk committee or audit committee, which would weaken the position of the shareholder. - some deem it sufficient to provide that the chair must be a non-executive member. Some respondents deem that, especially for the nomination committee, it should be sufficient that the chair be a non-executive director. Having an independent, non-executive chair could be considered appropriate for the audit committee. Some respondents are of the view that the prohibition on a dual chair applicable to all the committees, and the proposed rotation requirement, would aggravate the problem of complying with all the existing requirements for the constitution of specialised committees.

PARAGRAPH_99907: Some respondents deem that this is an operational task of the management body that does not concern the supervisory body in two-tier governance structures. The risk committee's job should be overseeing but not executing. The word 'examine' should therefore be replaced by 'oversee'. Some respondents suggest that 'all' should be removed from 'financial products' and to limit the requirement to material products in order to make the requirement practical. A detailed review of all financial products by the risk committee would be too time-consuming. The risk committee should not have to examine the alignment between all financial products and services offered to clients and the business model and risk strategy of the institution, but should only receive, on an annual basis, a report on such alignment covering significant risks.

PARAGRAPH_99908: The wording of the guidelines has been adjusted to stress the oversight role of the risk committee. The oversight should focus on material financial products and services.

PARAGRAPH_100042: Several respondents point out that it is not clear what the relationship between these two paragraphs is. One respondent suggests that it is sufficient to send reports on deviations to the management body and to send on an annual basis a report on how the implementation of and compliance with ethical and professional standards are ensured. The responsibility to review implementation and compliance should be allocated to the institution itself. One respondent suggests that such a review should be done by the compliance function.

PARAGRAPH_100047: The section has been clarified and deals now only with the conflict between private interests and the institution's interest.

PARAGRAPH_100130: One respondent points out that the guidelines allow the head of internal control functions to be subordinate to a senior executive who is not responsible for managing the activities monitored by the internal control area. CRD IV envisages that the head of risk will report directly to the management board in its supervisory function. For others, it is not compatible with national corporate laws in accordance with which the supervisory body is responsibly 'only' for overseeing the management body and not for overseeing the levels below the management body. It should be clarified that the heads of internal control functions have to report directly to the CEO, although they should have direct access to the board of directors.

It is obvious that the control functions have regular reporting lines to the management body in its management function. The heads of control functions should have direct access to the supervisory function and report to it when necessary, e.g. to warn it about adverse developments. In order to ensure that the control functions are independent, they cannot be subordinate to senior executives who are also responsible for managing business areas that are controlled by those functions.

PARAGRAPH_100271: Respondents propose reflecting existing laws in all Member States. In line with the response on paragraph 72, respondents consider that the definition of the roles and responsibilities of the compliance function might conflict with the definitions already in place in Member States.

PARAGRAPH_100279: The requirement to have a compliance policy and monitoring programme should not apply to small institutions. Smaller institutions should have standards or policies only for the most relevant areas, e.g. trading, anti-money laundering, data protection.

PARAGRAPH_100284: Non-compliance with internal and external standards can have a material impact on an institution's risk profile; close cooperation between those functions is therefore needed and usually established in practice.

PARAGRAPH_100321: The reference to the AMA has been moved to a footnote; the relevant parts of the regulation are still in force. The requirements apply to the institution; business continuity measures are needed also in the business lines. In large institutions, often a specific unit is created. Otherwise, this function can, for example, be part of the risk management function.

PARAGRAPH_100336: Some respondents point out that the criteria listed in Annex I do not allow institutions sufficient discretion to take into account their special features and do not sufficiently take into account national legal frameworks. Some respondents consider that points 6(c) and (d) are not appropriate: either they should be deleted, as they are part of the audit process, or it should be clarified that they refer to the overall handling of weaknesses identified and measures to manage them, and not to each individual case.

PARAGRAPH_100340: Respondents find it difficult to assess and estimate the costs that the guidelines will incur, especially because there remains some uncertainty as regards the application of the principle of proportionality and the level of application of the guidelines. According to respondents, costs would be significant if the guidelines were to be applied to each subsidiary/entity on an individual basis. Costs would be driven by the requirements to develop, adopt, implement, monitor and assess new policies and procedures. For instance, the requirement related to the development of ethical standards for external

Overall, the administrative burden caused by the guidelines would be non-negligible. More specifically, respondents have identified the following costs: the need to recruit additional staff to comply with the guidelines and inefficient allocation of managers' time. According to some respondents, both EU groups and subsidiaries of EU groups involved in non-regulated activities or activities regulated to a low degree would be penalised by those costs and suffer from a non-level playing field with non-EU groups and non-EU entities involved in non-regulated activities or activities regulated to a low degree, as these entities are supposed to apply lighter requirements in the field of corporate governance.
