PARAGRAPH_90393: Executive summary

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_90394: In recent years, internal governance issues have received increased attention from various international bodies. Their main aim has been to correct institutions' weak or superficial internal governance practices, as identified during the financial crisis. Recently, there has been a greater focus on conduct-related shortcomings, including compliance with the frameworkto prevent money laundering and terrorist financing and activities in offshore financial centres.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_90395: Sound internal governance arrangements are fundamental if institutions, individually and the banking system they form, are to operate well. Directive 2013/36/EU, as amended by Directive 2019/878/EU, reinforces the governance requirements for institutions and in particular, stresses the responsibility of the management body for sound governance arrangements; the importance of a strong supervisory function that challenges management decision-making; and the need to establish and implement a sound risk strategy, risk appetite and risk management framework.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_90396: To further harmonise institutions' internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms within the EU in line with the requirements introduced by Directive 2013/36/EU, the European Banking Authority (EBA) is mandated by Article 74(3) of Directive 2013/36/EU, to develop guidelines in this area. The guidelines apply to all institutions regardless of their governance structures (unitary board, dual board or other structure), without advocating or preferring any specific structure. The terms 'management body in its management function' and 'management body in its supervisory function' should be interpreted throughout the guidelines in accordance with the applicable law within each Member State.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_90397: The guidelines complete the various governance provisions in Directive 2013/36/EU, taking into account the principle of proportionality, by specifying the tasks, responsibilities and organisation of the management body, and the organisation of institutions, including the need to create transparent structures that allow for supervision of all their activities; the guidelines also specify further the requirements under Directive 2013/36/EU aimed at ensuring the sound management of risks across all three lines of defence and, in particular, set out detailed elements for the second line of defence (the independent risk management and compliance function) and the third line of defence (the internal audit function).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_90398: The guidelines are based on an earlier set of guidelines on internal governance and in particular add additional elements that aim to foster a sound risk culture implemented by the management body, to strengthen the management body's oversight of the institution's activities and to strengthen the risk management frameworks of institutions, e.g. by including the aspect of AML/TF risk factors.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_90403: 1. Trust in the reliability of the financial system is crucial for its proper functioning and a prerequisite if it is to contribute to the economy as a whole. Consequently, effective internal governance arrangements are fundamental if institutions, individually and the banking system they form, are to operate well.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_90404: 2. In recent years, internal governance issues have received increased attention from various international bodies. Their main aim has been to correct institutions' weak or superficial internal governance practices, as identified during the financial crisis. These faulty practices, while not a direct trigger for the financial crisis, were closely associated with it and were questionable. In addition, recently, there has been a greater focus on conduct-related shortcomings and activities in offshore financial centres.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_90405: 3. In some cases, at the time of the financial crisis the absence of effective checks and balances within institutions resulted in a lack of effective oversight of management decision-making, which led to short-term oriented and excessively risky management strategies. Weak oversight by the management body in its supervisory function has been identified as a contributing factor. The management body, both in its management function and, in particular, in its supervisory function, might not have understood the complexity of the business and the risks involved, consequently failing to identify and constrain excessive risk- taking in an effective manner.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_90406: 4. Internal governance frameworks, including internal control mechanisms and risk management, were often not sufficiently integrated within institutions or groups. There was a lack of a uniform methodology and terminology, so that a holistic view of all risks did not exist. Internal control functions often lacked appropriate resources, status and/or expertise.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_90407: 5. Conversely, sound internal governance practices helped some institutions to manage the financial crisis significantly better than others. These practices included the setting of an appropriate risk strategy and appropriate risk appetite levels, a holistic risk management framework and effective reporting lines to the management body.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_90408: 6. Against this background, there is a clear need to address the potentially detrimental effects of poorly designed internal governance arrangements on the sound management of risk, to ensure effective oversight by the management body, in particular in its supervisory function, to promote a sound risk culture at all levels of institutions and to enable competent authorities to supervise and monitor the adequacy of internal governance arrangements.

PARAGRAPH_90413: 7. The guidelines apply in the same way to institutions as to investment firms that are subject to Title VII of Directive 2013/36/EU1 as amended by Directive 2019/878/EU2 in application of Article 1(2) and (5) of Regulation 2019/2033/EU.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_90414: 8. To further harmonise institutions' internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms within the EU, the EBA is mandated by Article 74(3) of Directive 2013/36/EU to develop guidelines in this area.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_90415: 9. Article 74(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU, requires institutions to have robust governance arrangements, including a clear organisational structure with well-defined, transparent and consistent lines of responsibility.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_90416: 10. Article 76 of Directive 2013/36/EU sets out requirements for the involvement of the management body in risk management, the setting up of a risk committee for significant institutions, and the tasks and organisation of the risk management function. In addition, this article establishes 'that the head of the risk management function shall be an independent senior manager with distinct responsibility for the risk management function'. To reflect the wording of the directive, the revised guidelines refer, regarding the second line of defence, to the '(independent) risk management function', while the previous guidelines used the term '(independent) risk control function'. However, it should be remembered that business lines or units, as the first line of defence, have a material role in ensuring robust risk management and compliance within an institution.

PARAGRAPH_90417: 11. Article 88 of Directive 2013/36/EU sets out the responsibilities of the management body regarding governance arrangements, including the segregation of duties in the organisation and the prevention of conflicts of interest. Moreover, the directive sets out that Member States shall ensure that data on loans to members of the management body and their related parties are properly documented and made available to competent authorities upon request. Significant institutions are obliged under Paragraph 2 of this article to set up a nomination committee, unless under national law, the management body doesnot have any competence in the process of selection and appointment of any of its members.

PARAGRAPH_90426: 13. Under Article 109 (2) of Directive 2013/36/EU these guidelines apply on a sub-consolidated or consolidated basis. For this purpose, parent undertakings and subsidiaries subject to Directive 2013/36/EU must ensure that internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms in their subsidiaries are consistent, well integrated and that the governance arrangements on a consolidated basis are robust. In particular, it should be ensured that parent undertakings and subsidiaries subject to this directive implement such arrangements, processes and mechanisms in their subsidiaries not subject to this directive, including those established in third countries, including offshore financial centres. These arrangements, processes and mechanisms must also be consistent and well integrated and those subsidiaries not subject to this directive must also be able to produce any data and information relevant to the purpose of supervision. As set out in Article 109(2) CRD, subsidiary undertakings that are not themselves subject to this directive shall comply with their sector-specific requirements on an individual basis.

PARAGRAPH_90427: 14. In accordance with Article 109(3) of Directive 2013/36/EU, the requirement under Article 109(2) of this directive to ensure the application of Articles 74 to 96 of the directive also in subsidiaries not themselves subject to this directive does not apply only, if the EU parent institution can demonstrate that the application is unlawful under the law of the third country where the subsidiary is established. With regard to the application of the remuneration requirements laid down in Articles 92, 94 and 95 of Directive 2013/36/EU, Article 109(4) of that directive foresees that those provisions should not apply on a consolidated basis to subsidiaries that are not themselves subject to this directive under certain specific conditions3.

PARAGRAPH_90428: 15. Under Article 123(2) of Directive 2013/36/EU, competent authorities must require institutions to have in place adequate risk management processes and internal control mechanisms, including sound reporting and accounting procedures in order to identify, measure, monitor and control transactions with their parent mixed-activity holding company and its subsidiaries appropriately.

PARAGRAPH_90429: 16. In line with Article 47 of Directive 2013/36/EU, branches in a Member State of credit institutions authorised in a third country should be subject to equivalent requirements to those applicable to institutions within the Member State where the branch is located, taking into account, regarding internal governance arrangements, that the branch does not have a management body, but persons who are responsible for effectively directing the business.

PARAGRAPH_90436: Rationale and objective of the guidelines

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_90437: 18. Internal governance includes all standards and principles concerned with setting an institution's objectives, strategies and risk management framework; how its business is organised; how responsibilities and authority are defined and clearly allocated; how reporting lines are set up and what information they convey; and how the internal control framework is organised and implemented, including accounting procedures and remuneration policies. Internal governance also encompasses sound information technology systems, outsourcing arrangements and business continuity management.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_90438: 19. Combating money laundering and terrorist financing is essential for maintaining stability and integrity in the financial system. Uncovering involvement of an institution in money laundering and terrorist financing might have an impact on its viability and the trust in the financial system. Together with the authorities and bodies (e.g. AML supervisors and financial intelligence units) responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering rules under Directive (EU) 2015/849, competent authorities have an important role to play in identifying and tackling weaknesses. In this context, the guidelines clarify in line with Directive 2013/36/EU that identifying, managing and mitigating money laundering and financing of terrorism risk is part of sound internal governance arrangements and credit institutions' risk management framework.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_90439: 20. In the same way institutions should take into account environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk factors within their risk management framework.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_90440: 21. Directive 2013/36/EU sets out requirements aimed at remedying weaknesses that were identified during the financial crisis regarding internal governance arrangements and in particular the sound management and oversight of risks. Identified weaknesses included in particular a lack of effective oversight by the managementbody, in particular in its supervisory function, limited accessibility of the supervisory function and shortcomings regarding the authority, stature and resources of the risk management function.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_90441: 22. In addition, it is also necessary to take into account developments in this area since the publication of the revised EBA guidelines on internal governance in 2017, such as the updated OECD principles of corporate governance4 and the revised corporate governance principles for banks published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)5. The guidelines align the terminology used regarding risk appetite and risk tolerance with the EBA guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for the SREP and also with the revised BCBS principles; they use the term 'risk appetite' to refer to the aggregate level of risk and the types

PARAGRAPH_90449: 23. The guidelines are intended to apply to all existing board structures without interfering with the general allocation of competences in accordance with national company law or advocating any particular structure. Accordingly, they should be applied irrespective of the board structure used (a unitary and/or a dual board structure and/or another structure) across Member States. The management body, as defined in Points (7) and (8) of Article 3(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU, should be understood as having management (executive) and supervisory (non-executive) functions.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:9]
PARAGRAPH_90450: 24. The terms 'management body in its management function' and 'management body in its supervisory function' are used throughout these guidelines without referring to any specific governance structure, and references to the management (executive) or supervisory (non- executive) function should be understood as applying to the bodies or members of the management body responsible for that function in accordance with national law.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:9]
PARAGRAPH_90451: 25. In Member States where the management body delegates, partially or fully, the executive function to a person or an internal executive body (e.g. a chief executive officer (CEO), management team or executive committee), the persons who perform those executive functions and direct the business of the institution on the basis of that delegation should be understood as constituting the management function of the management body. For the purposes of these guidelines, any reference to the management body in its management function should be understood as including also the members of the executive body or the CEO, as defined in these guidelines, even if they have not been proposed or appointed as formal members of the institution's governing body or bodies under national law.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:9]
PARAGRAPH_90452: 26. The management body is empowered to set the institution's strategy, objectives and overall direction, and oversees and monitors management decision-making. The management body in its management function directs the institution. Senior management is accountable to the management body for the day-to-day running of the institution. The management body in its supervisory function oversees and challenges the management function and provides appropriate advice. The oversight roles include reviewing the performance of the management function and the achievement of objectives, challenging the strategy, and monitoring and scrutinising the systems that ensure the integrity of financial information as well as the soundness and effectiveness of risk management and internal controls.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:9]
PARAGRAPH_90453: 27. Taking into consideration all existing governance structures provided for by national laws, competent authorities should ensure the effective and consistent application of the guidelines in their jurisdictions in accordance with the rationale and objectives of the guidelines themselves. For this purpose, competent authorities may clarify the governing bodies and functions to which the tasks and responsibilities set forth in the guidelines pertain, when this is appropriate to ensure the proper application of the guidelines in accordance with the governance structures provided for under national company law.

PARAGRAPH_90459: 29. With regard to the composition of committees and, in particular, with regard to independent members, the guidelines are in line with the BCBS principles on corporate governance, which set out guidance for the largest institutions. To take into account the principle of proportionality, simpler elements have been introduced for smaller institutions.

PARAGRAPH_90460: 30. The guidelines are consistent with the 'three lines of defence' model in identifying the functions within institutions responsible for addressing and managing risks.

PARAGRAPH_90461: 31. The business lines, as part of the first line of defence, take risks and are responsible fortheir operational management directly and on a permanent basis. For that purpose, business lines should have appropriate processes and controls in place that aim to ensure that risks are identified, analysed, measured, monitored, managed, reported and kept within the limits of the institution's risk appetite and that the business activities are in compliance with external and internal requirements.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:10] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_90462: 32. Not only business lines, but also other functions or units, e.g. HR, legal or information technology, are responsible for managing their risks and having appropriate controls in place. Other functions or units are mainly exposed to operational and reputational risks that must be considered by the compliance function and risk management function when forming an enterprise-wide holistic view on all risks. All other functions or units should also be subject to the monitoring and oversight by the independent risk management and compliance function on a risk-based approach.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:10] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_90463: 33. The risk management function and compliance function form the second line of defence. Institutions may set up additional specific control functions (e.g. IT security control or AML compliance function). The risk management function (referred to in the previous guidelines as the 'risk control function') facilitates the implementation of a sound risk management framework throughout the institution and has responsibility for further identifying, monitoring, analysing, measuring, managing and reporting risks and forming a holistic view on all risks on an individual and consolidated basis. It challenges and assists in the implementation of risk management measures by the business lines in order to ensure that the process and controls in place at the first line of defence are properly designed and effective. The compliance function monitors compliance with legal requirements and internal policies, provides advice on compliance to the management body and other relevant staff, and establishes policies and processes to manage compliance risks and to ensure compliance. Both functions may intervene to ensure the modification of internal control and risk management systems within the first line of defence where necessary.

PARAGRAPH_90464: 6 In this regard, the guidelines are based on the Commission Recommendation of 15 February 2005 on the role of non- executive or supervisory directors of listed companies and on the committees of the (supervisory) board.

PARAGRAPH_90469: 34. The independent internal audit function, as the third line of defence, conducts risk-based and general audits and reviews the internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms to ascertain that they are sound and effective, implemented and consistently applied. The internal audit function is also in charge of the independent review of the first two lines of defence, including other internal functions, units and business lines. The internal audit function performs its tasks fully independently of the other lines of defence.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:11] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_90470: 35. To ensure their proper functioning, all internal control functions need to be independent of the business they control, have the appropriate financial and human resources to perform their tasks, and report directly to the management body. Within all three lines of defence, appropriate internal control procedures, mechanisms and processes should be designed, developed, maintained and evaluated under the ultimate responsibility of the management body.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:11]
PARAGRAPH_90471: 36. All elements within the guidelines are subject to the principle of proportionality, meaning that they are to be applied in a manner that is appropriate, taking into account in particular the institution's size, internal organisation and nature, and the complexity of its activities.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:11]
PARAGRAPH_90472: 37. The guidelines specify further the requirements under Directive 2013/36/EU that need to be considered when setting up new structures, e.g. in third countries, including also offshore financial centres, and which aim to increase the transparency of and reduce the risks connected with such activities. Guidelines are also provided regarding the reporting of institutions on governance arrangements, including in relation to such structures.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:11] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_90473: 38. The guidelines aim to establish a sound risk culture in institutions. Risks should be taken within a well-defined framework in line with the institution's risk strategy and risk appetite. This includes the establishment of and ensuring compliance with a system of limits and controls. Risks within new products and business areas, but also risks that may result from changes to institutions' products, processes and systems, are to be duly identified, assessed, appropriately managed and monitored. The risk management function and compliance function should be involved in the establishment of the framework and the approval of such changes to ensure that all material risks are taken into account and that the institution complies with all internal and external requirements.

PARAGRAPH_90474: 39. To ensure objective decision-making, oversight and compliance with external and internal requirements, including institutions' strategies and risk limits, institutions should implement a conflict-of-interest policy and internal whistleblowing procedures.

PARAGRAPH_90475: 40. In order to prevent conflicts of interest, the management body should ensure that a framework for the identification and, where necessary, mitigation of conflicts of interests exist. The institution, its organisational substructures, staff and shareholders hold different interests that should be considered in such a framework in order to ensure that decisions are taken objectively. Examples of typical sources of conflicts of interests are diverging economic

PARAGRAPH_90481: 41. The management body has the highest decision-making powers, consequently the identification and management of conflicts of interest of members of the management body and parties closely related to the members of the management body is a cornerstone of sound internal governance practices. Therefore, the guidelines specify measures that should be implemented by institutions to prudently manage conflicts of interests that may arise from granting loans to and entering into other transactions with members of the management body and their related parties.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:19] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_90587: 16. The proportionality principle encoded in Article 74(2) of Directive 2013/36/EU aims to ensure that internal governance arrangements are consistent with the individual risk profile and business model of the institution, so that the objectives of the regulatory requirements and provisions are effectively achieved.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:19] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_90588: 17. Institutions should take into account their size and internal organisation, and the nature, scale and complexity of their activities, when developing and implementing internal governance arrangements. Significant institutions should have more sophisticated governance arrangements, while small and less complex institutions may implement simpler governance arrangements. Institutions should however note that the size or systemic importance of an institution may not, by itself, be indicative of the extent to which an institution is exposed to risks.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:19]

PARAGRAPH_90779: 68. The management body of an institution should ensure a suitable and transparent organisational and operational structure for that institution and should have a written description of it. The structure should promote and demonstrate the effective and prudent management of an institution at individual, sub-consolidated and consolidated levels. The management body should ensure that the internal control functions are independent of the business lines they control, including that there is an adequate segregation of duties, and that they have the appropriate financial and human resources as well as powers to effectively perform their role. The reporting lines and the allocation of responsibilities, in particular among key function holders, within an institution should be clear, well-defined, coherent, enforceable and duly documented.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:47] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_91008: 141. Institutions should develop and maintain a culture that encourages a positive attitude towards risk control and compliance within the institution and a robust and comprehensive internal control framework. Under this framework, institutions' business lines should be responsible for managing the risks they incur in conducting their activities and should have controls in place that aim to ensure compliance with internal and external requirements. As part of this framework, institutions should have internal control functions with appropriate and sufficient authority, stature and access to the management body to fulfil their mission, and a risk management framework.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:47]
PARAGRAPH_91009: 142. The internal control framework of institutions should be adapted on an individual basis to the specificity of its business, its complexity and the associated risks, taking into account the group context. Institutions should organise the exchange of the necessary information in a manner that ensures that each management body, business line and internal unit, including each internal control function, is able to carry out its duties. This means, for example, a necessary exchange of adequate information between the business lines and the compliance function and the AML/CFT compliance function where it is a separate control function, at the group level and between the heads of the internal control functions at the group level and the management body of the institution.

PARAGRAPH_91027: 149. When implementing the internal control framework, institutions should establish adequate segregation of duties - e.g. entrusting conflicting activities within the processing of transactions or when providing services to different persons, or entrusting supervisory and reporting responsibilities for conflicting activities to different persons - and establish information barriers, e.g. through the physical separation of certain departments.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:49]
PARAGRAPH_91035: 152. 2. As part of the overall internal control framework, institutions should have a holistic institution-wide risk management framework extending across all its business lines and internal units, including internal control functions, recognising fully the economic substance of all its risk exposures. The risk management framework should enable the institution to make fully informed decisions on risk-taking. The risk management framework should encompass on- and off-balance-sheet risks as well as actual risks and future risks that the institution may be exposed to. Risks should be evaluated from the bottom up and from the top down, within and across business lines, using consistent terminology and compatible methodologies throughout the institution and at consolidated or sub-consolidated level. All relevant risks should be encompassed in the risk management framework with appropriate consideration of both financial and non-financial risks, including credit, market, liquidity, concentration, operational, IT, reputational, legal, conduct, compliance with AML/CTF and other financial crime, ESG, and strategic risks.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:49]
PARAGRAPH_91036: 153. An institution's risk management framework should include policies, procedures, risk limits and risk controls ensuring adequate, timely and continuous identification, measurement or assessment, monitoring, management, mitigation and reporting of the risks at the business line, institution and consolidated or sub-consolidated levels.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:49] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_91037: 154. An institution's risk management framework should provide specific guidance on the implementation of its strategies. This guidance should, where appropriate, establish and maintain internal limits consistent with the institution's risk appetite and commensurate with its sound operation, financial strength, capital base and strategic goals. An institution's risk profile should be kept within these established limits. The risk management framework should ensure that, whenever breaches of risk limits occur, there is a defined process to escalate and address them with an appropriate follow-up procedure.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:49]
PARAGRAPH_91038: 155. The risk management framework should be subject to independent internal review, e.g. performed by the internal audit function, and reassessed regularly against the institution's risk appetite, taking into account information from the risk management function and, where established, the risk committee. Factors that should be considered include internal and external developments, including balance-sheet and revenue changes; any increase in the complexity of the institution's business, risk profile or operating structure; geographic expansion; mergers and acquisitions; and the introduction of new products or business lines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:49]
PARAGRAPH_91039: 156. When identifying and measuring or assessing risks, an institution should develop appropriate methodologies including both forward-looking and backward-looking tools. The methodologies should allow for the aggregation of risk exposures across business lines and support the identification of risk concentrations. The tools should include the assessment of the actual risk profile against the institution's risk appetite, as well as the identification and assessment of potential and stressed risk exposures under a range of assumed adverse circumstances against the institution's risk capacity. The tools should provide information on

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:50]
PARAGRAPH_91045: 157. Institutions should take into consideration that the results of quantitative assessment methodologies, including stress testing, are highly dependent on the limitations and assumptions of the models (including the severity and duration of the shock and the underlying risks). For example, models showing very high returns on economic capital may result from a weakness in the models (e.g. the exclusion of some relevant risks) rather than a superior strategy or excellent execution of a strategy on the part of the institution. The determination of the level of risk taken should not therefore be based only on quantitative information or model outputs; it should also comprise a qualitative approach (including expert judgement and critical analysis). Relevant macroeconomic environmental trends and data should be explicitly addressed to identify their potential impact on exposures and portfolios.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:50] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_91046: 158. The ultimate responsibility for risk assessment lies solely with the institution, which, accordingly, should evaluate its risks critically and should not rely exclusively on external assessments. For example, an institution should validate a purchased risk model and calibrate it to its own individual circumstances to ensure that the model accurately and comprehensively captures and analyses the risk.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:50]
PARAGRAPH_91047: 159. Institutions should be fully aware of the limitations of models and metrics and use not only quantitative but also qualitative risk assessment tools (including expert judgement and critical analysis).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:50]
PARAGRAPH_91048: 160. In addition to the institutions' own assessments, institutions may use external risk assessments (including external credit ratings or externally purchased risk models ). Institutions should be fully aware of the exact scope of such assessments and their limitations.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:50]
PARAGRAPH_91049: 161. Regular and transparent reporting mechanisms should be established so that the management body, its risk committee, where established, and all relevant units in an institution are provided with reports in a timely, accurate, concise, understandable and meaningful manner and can share relevant information about the identification, measurement or assessment, monitoring and management of risks. The reporting framework should be well defined and documented.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:50]
PARAGRAPH_91050: 162. Effective communication and awareness regarding risks and the risk strategy is crucial for the whole risk management process, including the review and decision -making processes, and helps prevent decisions that may unknowingly increase risk. Effective risk reporting involves sound internal consideration and communication of risk strategy and relevant risk data (e.g. exposures and keyrisk indicators), both horizontally across the institution and up and down the management chain.

An institution should have in place a well-documented new product approval policy (NPAP), approved by the management body, that addresses the development of new markets, products and services, and significant changes to existing ones, as well as exceptional transactions. The policy should in addition encompass material changes to related processes (e.g. new outsourcing arrangements) and systems (e.g. IT change processes). The NPAP should ensure that approved products and changes are consistent with the risk strategy and risk appetite of the institution and the corresponding limits of the institution, or that necessary revisions are made.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:51]
PARAGRAPH_91059: 166. An institution's NPAP should cover every consideration to be taken into account before deciding to enter new markets, deal in new products, launch a new service, or make significant changes to existing products or services.

Furthermore, to comply with obligations under Directive (EU) 2015/849, institutions should identify and assess the ML/TF risk associated with the new product or business practice, and set out the measures to take to mitigate those risks. The decision to launch a new activity should clearly state the business unit and individuals responsible for it.

This analysis should cover all business lines and internal units, including the RMF, and should take into account their interdependency. The results of the analysis should contribute to defining the institution's recovery priorities and objectives.

The amendments to the guidelines should ensure that institutions have specific governance arrangements regarding the management of money laundering and terrorist financing risks and to avoid that they contribute to dividend arbitrage schemes.

PARAGRAPH_91289: 7. The guidelines provide additional clarity about the institutions internal governance in the context of AML/CTF provisions. Institutions should already have sufficient governance arrangements in place to ensure that they comply with Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorist Financing and tax laws. The related risks are already covered by the CRD requirement on institutions to manage all their risks. Hence, the clarifications provided in the guidelines should not trigger any implementation costs if the institution concerned already had the required arrangements in place and had implemented the requirements under Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:66] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_91290: 8. In addition the guidelines have been clarified regarding the management of conflicts of interest in relation to loans and other transactions to members of the management body and their related parties. Given that specific provisions have been added to Directive 2013/36/EU it was considered necessary to clarify the regulatory expectations and the requirements with regard to the documentation of such loans and the management of related conflicts of interest. It is necessary that institutions document all loans and transactions. The specific documentation elements on such loans in the guidelines are limited and do not create a material burden. The need to identify such loans, to document them and to comply with the GDPR in this context is created by the requirement within the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). Hence, the costs for those aspects are not assessed as part of this impact assessment.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:66] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_91291: 9. The objective of the changes are that there is sufficient scrutiny on decisions regarding such loans and that conflicts of interest in that context are appropriately managed. Restricting the guidelines to loans to members of the management body and their related parties would not be effective as other transactions might also create material conflicts of interests. Limited additional documentation elements regarding the conditions of such loans as compared to market conditions and their volumes are necessary to assess the appropriateness of the management of conflicts of interests. Given the need to document contractual conditions and to comply e.g. with the large loan regime it is assessed that the additional costs for providing the additional information, when requested, is low.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:66]
PARAGRAPH_91292: 10. In line with the principle of proportionality, the guidelines differentiate between material and non-material loans and transactions. The guidelines further specify the already existing CRD requirements for all institutions.

Given the limited amendments to the guidelines and given that they are based on amendments of Directive 2013/36/EU and other existing legal requirements, it is assumed that changes to the guidelines create no or very low implementation costs for updates to internal policies and additional documentation.

PARAGRAPH_91300: The EBA published its consultation paper on 31 July 2020 and received overall 18 responses; 16 of them were published, while the other 2 have been submitted on a confidential basis. The consultation was limited to the changes made to the guidelines previously in place.

PARAGRAPH_91302: Many respondents challenged the legal basis to ask institutions for specific actions regarding third party transactions, while the CRD includes only specific documentation requirements on loans to members of the management body and their related parties.

PARAGRAPH_91303: The submission of information on loans to members of the management body and their related parties is set out in Article 88 of the CRD, and the management of conflicts of interests is also explicitly required under Article 88 of the CRD. Decisions on related party loans and transactions should be made objectively and related conflicts of interests must be identified and managed. The guidelines have been aligned with the CRD requirements and specify them further. The guidelines further specify how conflicts of interest in this context should be managed and which information on such loans should be made available to competent authorities upon request.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:67]
PARAGRAPH_91304: Many institutions had objections to the provision that a member of the management body should be identified as being responsible for implementation of the requirements in Directive 2018/843 (AMLDV) on anti-money laundering and terrorist financing. Moreover, some respondents would preferto remove the guidance provided in light of other upcoming EBA work on this topic.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:67] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_91305: The guidelines have been aligned with the requirements under AMLDV, which is in the scope of the EBA's action. Institutions' governance arrangements must take into account the risks that can emerge from being involved or being exploited in the context of money laundering and terrorist financing. The management body bears the overall responsibility for implementing the related policies and processes. However, many national laws, in line with the AMLDV, indeed foresee that companies that are subject to the AMLDV must identify one member of the management body, where such a body exists, as being responsible. The EBA is working on additional guidelines on AML compliance, while the guidelines on internal governance set out high level principles on AML compliance and principles on the management of risks triggered by ML/TF risk factors. The AML/CTF framework is part of institutions governance arrangements and therefore the topic has been retained within the guidelines.

PARAGRAPH_91306: Other comments received concern the principles included regarding non-discrimination and equal opportunities and respondents found that those guidelines would exceed the EBA's mandate.

PARAGRAPH_91327: The EBA has reviewed the mentioned guidelines and ensured that definitions are consistent. However, smaller differentiations were necessary, given their different scope of application, e.g. the term 'relevant institution' also includes Class 2 investment firms, while the present GL do not apply to such investment firms. The definition of 'prudential consolidation' has been added for the sake of completeness, while it is, in principle, not necessary as the method to be used and its scope is set out in Regulation (EU) 575/2013.

PARAGRAPH_91370: ML/FT risks in the internal control and general risk management framework

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:71]
PARAGRAPH_91371: Several respondents suggest clarifying if the GL aim to integrate the AML/CTF check in the general risk management. If so, clarifications are also needed on the effects on the responsibilities within the credit institutions. For some respondents, AML should not be arbitrarily dropped into the 'overarching internal controls' section. It should instead be included within its own sub-heading as a sub-topic. A few respondents commented that the results of the AML/CTF check should not have any impact on regulatory requirements, especially not on capital requirements; a negative result of the AML/CTF check can only result in the rejection or increased monitoring of the business relationship. Many respondents recommend more proportionality on the requirement to adopt specific risk mitigation measures: they evidence that, with regard to operational and reputational risks arising from ML/TF risks, such measures are not necessary for all institutions, depending largely on the nature and complexity of individual business activities.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:71] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_91372: The GL have been clarified. Institutions need to take into account money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risk factors in their general risk management. However, they also need to ensure compliance with the provisions under Directive (EU) 2015/849 (AMLD), including that they implement appropriate AML/CTF controls. While both issues are related, their context (prudential/compliance) differs. While the AMLD requires specific measures, the present guidelines deal with the internal governance of institutions and its risk management in more general. Hence, singling out AML provisions, rather than integrating such requirements in the control framework, has not been seen as appropriate. Moreover, the EBA is going to issue additional guidelines in the area of AML/CTF compliance. In any case, institutions need to be aware that AML/CTF breaches can also lead to operational and reputational risks and, if systematic, doubts regarding the suitability of members of the management body. The present guidelines do not contain provisions that are related to potential capital add-ons. It is self-evident that the needed controls and risk mitigation measures should take into account the existing risk factors and risk levels.

PARAGRAPH_91388: Some respondents comment that the reference to 'offshore financial centres' is not clearly defined.

PARAGRAPH_91389: The GL reflect the wording within the CRD. Indeed, the application of the CRD requirements outside the EU on a consolidated basis is not different between 'third countries' and 'offshore financial centres'. While international bodies, e.g. the IMF provide for a definition of 'offshore financial centres', the CRD does not. It has been clarified that there is no differentiation of the CRD requirements between third countries and offshore financial centres.

PARAGRAPH_91412: One respondent asks whether the renaming to 'three lines model' by the Institute of Internal Auditors has a bearing on these guidelines and the name of the 'three lines of defence' model. The IIA's model allows the 1st and 2nd line to be blended. This is quite a substantial difference compared to these guidelines which clearly require the independence of the control functions in credit institutions. The respondent requests how the EBA will take the IIA's three lines model into consideration.

PARAGRAPH_91416: One respondent asks for revision of the background section as regards the compliance function's scope of responsibility is defined too broad and prescriptive. Even though the compliance function is considered to be a crucial function for ensuring compliance with laws and regulations, it should not be responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations but rather with those related to the Compliance function as such.

PARAGRAPH_91417: The background section is clear and provides an overview on the internal organisation of the institution. The guidelines further specify the CRD requirements. It is deemed sufficiently clear, that the compliance function does not carry all those responsibilities all on its own, but together with the first line of defence and other functions (e.g. legal unit) within the institution.

PARAGRAPH_91432: One respondent recommends to review the definitions and operate with one set of definitions for the guidelines on internal governance and the guidelines on fitness and propriety (e.g. definition of staff, prudential consolidation). The term 'relevant institutions' has been introduced in the guidelines on fitness and propriety and makes it difficult to further differentiate between the categories of institutions that are now in scope (there are overall 6 categories: 'institutions', 'CRD-institutions', 'relevant institutions', 'significant CRD-institutions', 'listed relevant institutions and listed institutions', 'consolidating credit institutions'); on the other side, the Internal Governance GL operates with the terms 'significant credit institutions' and 'listed CRD credit institutions'.

PARAGRAPH_91433: The definitions within the guidelines have been reviewed and aligned to the extent possible.

PARAGRAPH_91495: corporate laws that, for instance, apply the principles of collegiality and joint and several responsibility to the management body (e.g., in one-tier board systems). They also highlight that Article 46(4) AMLD, when setting 'where applicable', leaves room for Member States to stipulate otherwise, the topic still not being sufficiently harmonised. In one-tier systems it could entail assigning that responsibility to an executive director (e.g., the CEO, who is in many instances the sole executive member within the board 'effectively directing the institution'), and that would put into question the independence and accountability framework from internal control functions envisaged in the guidelines on internal governance. It would also be impossible in a hybrid system where there is a CEO who can be (but is not systemically) part of the board of directors. Respondents find it is hard to see the rationale behind a new accountability regime, applicable only to AML/CTF issues, where responsibility would lie with a member of the management body instead of with the corresponding internal control head (accountable directly to the management body as a whole). A few respondents suggest merging Para. 23(c) and (d) to avoid creating two parallel control frameworks.

PARAGRAPH_91496: Given the upcoming additional work, the guidelines have been revised to only include high-level principles re the AML/CTF compliance officer and compliance function and related responsibilities at the level of the management body. Where the head of a control function is a member of the management body, institutions should be mindful of any possible conflicts of interests. The same applies when assigning responsibilities regarding the AML/CTF function. The allocation of such responsibilities to a member of the management body does not reduce the overall responsibility of the management body for this topic as prescribed in Art. 88 CRD.

PARAGRAPH_91579: are in line with the EBA's Guidelines, no further implementation burden would exist. It is not necessary to have one single document containing all the measures taken, but institutions must be able to demonstrate that they have ensured that there is no discrimination in the meaning of the guidelines. Institutions should actively aim at increasing the pool of suitable candidates for positions within the management body. By improving the gender balance in positions directly below the management body, institutions will be able to better take into account gender diversity when recruiting members of the management body (see also Art. 91 CRD). The guidelines have been revised and fully aligned with the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.

PARAGRAPH_91580: Question 6 Corporate values and code of conduct - tax offences - illicit dividend arbitrage schemes Para. 101(c)

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:81]
PARAGRAPH_91581: Several respondents suggest deleting the provision on tax offences, but in particular on dividend arbitrage schemes, deeming it unnecessary, too vague and not appropriate to specifically point out to one particular kind of tax evasion scheme. The word 'illicit' is not sufficiently clear. Alternatively, it was suggested by some respondents to limit this provision to cases where a court decision or a decision from the AML/CFT supervisor has been issued or where the competent authority have found a particular practice to be illicit. One respondent asks for clarification of the obligation on banks to prevent tax crimes.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:81] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_91582: The amendment of the guidelines is necessary to stress that tax offences are a relevant factor that should be considered within the code of conduct. The term 'illicit' covers schemes that are unlawful or are banned; the wording has been clarified. Institutions have no active role in prosecuting clients for committing tax crimes, but, as part of money laundering controls, institutions must have appropriate controls to prevent them being used by customers for money laundering, including the use of funds derived from tax offences, purposes.

The proposed exclusion would apply, for instance, to transactions with (i) the sole shareholder; (ii) subsidiaries or (iii) commercial entities (corporate banking) including, for example, companies where a close family member holds a senior management position or has a share of 10%; or entities where the board member has no influence (for example where the board member holds a non-executive directorship and where decisions are taken collectively); (iv) shareholders and companies on which the credit institution exerts control or significant influence; (v) the shareholder of the credit institution who is represented in the supervisory function of the management body by its managing director or a person with a senior management position; (vi) the management board member who holds a supervisory board function in a subsidiary.

PARAGRAPH_91820: Some respondents suggest clarifying which 'other' compliance functions are referred to. Some of them ask for clarification that the reference to compliance may be covered by a separate Anti-Financial Crime (AFC) function, if this exists within an organisation. Consequently it is suggested including either AFC in the definition of 'compliance' or in a second sentence before internal audit in Para. 166. One of the respondents asks if AML/TF shall be a separate control function.

PARAGRAPH_91821: The guidelines do not aim at requiring additional control functions, but allow for them to be installed by the institution. It is not uncommon that larger institutions have separate control functions that are, as a second line of defence, responsible for overseeing and managing AML risks. Institutions e.g. may also have a separate function for information security risks. However, the guidelines leave it to institutions to set up additional control functions, determine their scope of action and label them.
