PARAGRAPH_83353: These guidelines, drawn up pursuant to Article 107(3) of Directive 2013/36/EU, are addressed to competent authorities and are intended to promote common procedures and methodologies for the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP), which is an ongoing supervisory process bringing together findings from all supervisory activities into a comprehensive supervisory overview of an institution. These guidelines also aim to achieve convergence of practices followed by competent authorities in supervisory stress testing across the EU in accordance with Article 100 of Directive 2013/36/EU.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_83354: The EBA has developed these revised SREP Guidelines in order to implement the changes brought by Directive (EU) 2019/878 amending Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) 2019/876 amending Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. The revision of the SREP Guidelines, while keeping the original framework with the main SREP elements intact, reflects the amendments at Level 1, which include, among other things, the introduction of the assessment of the risk of excessive leverage and the revision of the methodology for the determination of the Pillar-2 Guidance. This revision is also aimed at aligning the text with other relevant guidelines, technical standards, as well as enhancing the guidance by incorporating identified best practices. Additional relevant changes are related to the enhancement of the principle of proportionality as well as the encouragement of cooperation among prudential supervisory authorities and AML/CFT supervisors, as well as resolution authorities.

PARAGRAPH_83360: Regular monitoring of key indicators is used to identify material changes in the risk profile and to support the SREP framework. The specific elements of the SREP framework are assessed and scored on a scale of 1 to 4. The outcome of the assessments, both individually and considered as a whole, forms the basis for the overall SREP assessment, which represents the up-to-date supervisory view of the institution's overall viability. It should also form the basis for supervisory measures and dialogue with the institution.

PARAGRAPH_83361: These guidelines make a link between ongoing supervision, as addressed in Directive 2013/36/EU, and determining whether the institution is 'failing or likely to fail', as addressed in Directive 2014/59/EU. This is through the SREP assessment of the institution's viability, as measured by the overall SREP assessment and the overall SREP score. The overall SREP score has four positive grades to be applied to viable institutions (1 to 4) and one negative grade ('F') indicating that the

PARAGRAPH_83379: Background and rationale

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_83380: The EBA is mandated to foster sound and effective supervision and to drive supervisory convergence across the EU arising from the requirements specified in Directive 2013/36/EU (CRD) and more generally from its obligations under its founding regulation. The Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) is one of the main tools for supervision, through which competent authorities form a comprehensive view on the risk profile of the institutions, as well as on their overall viability and sustainability, and may impose adequate supervisory measures to ensure material risks are properly addressed.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_83381: Article 107 of the CRD mandates the EBA to draft guidelines for competent authorities, specifying the common procedures and methodologies for the SREP and for the assessment of the organisation and treatment of risks referred to in Articles 76 to 87 of the CDR, in a manner that is appropriate to the size, structure and internal organisation of institutions, and the nature, scope, and complexity of their activities. Additionally, Article 100(2) of the CRD empowers the EBA to issue guidelines to ensure that common methodologies are used by competent authorities when conducting annual supervisory stress tests for SREP purposes. Based on that mandate, the EBA's primary objective for the guidelines is the improvement of the quality and consistency of SREP practices, and consequently, of their outcomes. The consequences of the adoption of the guidelines should be that institutions with similar risk profiles, business models and geographic exposures are reviewed and assessed by competent authorities consistently and subject to broadly equivalent supervisory expectations, actions and measures, where applicable, including institution-specific prudential requirements. To achieve this objective, in addition to specifying the SREP procedures and methodologies, these guidelines also provide guidance for subsequent supervisory measures that competent authorities should consider, as specified in the CRD.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_83382: In accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, the EBA issues guidelines addressed to competent authorities, with a view to establishing consistent, efficient and effective supervisory practices and ensuring that there is common, uniform, and consistent application of European Union law.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_83383: The aim of these guidelines is to ensure the harmonisation of the SREP framework, while not imposing restrictive granular SREP procedures and methodologies, as this would not be in line with the CRD, mandating the drafting of guidelines rather than of binding technical standards. Competent authorities should, however, apply these guidelines in a way that will not compromise intended harmonisation and convergence thereof, particularly ensuring that high supervisory standards are implemented in the EU and that there is no room for supervisory arbitrage.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_83384: These guidelines set out the common SREP framework, taking into account the requirements of Regulation (EU) 575/2013 (CRR) and the CRD, ensuring consistency with other EU regulatory products including other EBA guidelines, as well as considering the outcomes of the EBA monitoring and assessment of convergence and supervisory practices, as requested by Article 107 of the CRD.

PARAGRAPH_83389: The SREP Guidelines were first published in December 2014 and became applicable since January 2016. The first update took place in 2017 and the revised Guidelines became applicable since 2019. The second review carried out in 2021 aims at aligning the Guidelines with other regulatory developments that took place since the latest revision of the SREP Guidelines. In particular, these revised guidelines take into account changes stemming from Directive (EU) 2019/878 amending the CRD and Regulation (EU) 2019/876 amending the CRR, as well as the issuance by the EBA of other relevant guidelines and technical standards.

PARAGRAPH_83390: The cyclical nature of the SREP assessment advocates the overall SREP framework to be applicable at the beginning of a SREP cycle. Against this background, considering that the SREP cycle often corresponds to a calendar year, these guidelines apply from 1 January 2023. However, competent authorities are encouraged to consider the revised guidance and introduce into the current cycle as many elements as possible.

Such categorisation impacts the minimum engagement level, graduating the frequency of assessment, which drives the dialogue with the institution for the purposes of assessing individual SREP elements and the overall SREP assessment. In addition, the categorisation takes into account the definitions of small and non-complex institutions as well as large institutions, as set out in the CRR, to ensure consistency in the scope of application of proportionality within the overall regulatory framework.

PARAGRAPH_83422: Without undermining the responsibility of the institution's management body for organising and running its business, the supervisory business model analysis should be the assessment of the viability of the current business model and the sustainability of the strategic plans. This analysis should also assist in revealing key vulnerabilities the institution is facing that may not be revealed by other elements of the SREP, including vulnerabilities stemming from ML/TF and ESG risks. Such analysis does not aim to rank the institutions' various business models.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:10]
PARAGRAPH_83424: As part of the overall governance assessment, competent authorities should determine whether the internal governance framework of an institution is adequate given its risk profile, size, nature and complexity, and whether the institution sufficiently adheres to the requirements and standards of good internal governance and risk controls arrangements, including aspects such as diversity, non-discrimination and sound code of conduct.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:10] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_83425: As part of the risk management framework, competent authorities should review the institution's internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) and internal liquidity adequacy assessment process (ILAAP). The assessment should focus on the soundness, effectiveness and comprehensiveness of these processes, as well as on the reliability of the institution's internal estimates to support the supervisory determination of capital and liquidity adequacy. Furthermore, competent authorities should also assess the adequacy of institution's stress testing programmes, including scenarios and assumptions, and outcomes.

PARAGRAPH_83433: 6. Assessment of the adequacy of institution's own funds:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:11] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_83434: Since an institution may face risks that are not covered or not fully covered by the own funds requirements in accordance with the CRR or the capital buffers specified in the CRD, the SREP Guidelines include guidance on the determination of the quantity and composition of additional own funds requirements (P2R) determined to cover such risks, emphasising on their institution- specific nature. As a separate stack of own funds requirements, the SREP Guidelines also include guidance on the assessment of the risk of excessive leverage and on the determination of the quantity and composition of additional own funds required to cover that risk (P2R-LR). Such P2R and P2R-LR should be set in a legally binding way, and institutions should be expected to meet them at all times.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:11]
PARAGRAPH_83435: The determination of P2R and P2R-LR should be duly justified to institutions. Aiming to enhance the supervisory dialogue, the SREP Guidelines include guidance on the minimum scope of information and justification of the results of the SREP to be provided to institutions. Separate justification is expected for the leverage ratio capital layer and the risk-based capital layer.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:11]
PARAGRAPH_83436: Where the outcomes of the relevant stress tests suggest that an institution may not be able to meet the applicable own funds requirements under stress conditions, or is excessively sensitive to the assumed scenarios, competent authorities should take appropriate supervisory measures to ensure the institution is adequately capitalised, including the imposition of guidance on additional own funds, separately, to address the risk of excessive leverage and other risks (P2G-LR and P2G). The SREP Guidelines provide guidance clarifying the setting of the P2G and P2G-LR, encompassing both the use of the results of the stress tests, where the maximum anticipated stress test impact should be considered, and possible adjustments depending on institution-specific circumstances. As P2G and P2G-LR are positioned above the combined buffer requirements, a failure to meet such requirements does not trigger automatic restrictions on distribution provided for in Article 141 of the CRD.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:11]
PARAGRAPH_83437: To increase convergence and level the playing field between institutions, the SREP Guidelines specify the quality of capital competent authorities should require institutions to hold to meet their guidance on additional own funds, CET1 capital for P2G coverage, and Tier 1 for P2G-LR coverage, respectively.

Competent authorities should also consider any necessary supervisory measures to address concerns.

PARAGRAPH_83449: To help facilitate communication with the competent authorities and colleges of supervisors, foster comparability and a level playing field across institutions as well as to adequately prioritise supervisory resources and measures in the assessment of SREP elements, competent authorities should score from a range of '1' (low risk) to '4' (high risk), to reflect the supervisory view for reach element-specific title of the guidelines. Scores should be assigned based on supervisory judgement, taking into account assessment considerations provided in the guidelines. These guidelines introduce two types of scores, the first one indicating the likelihood that the risks to capital, liquidity and funding will have a significant impact on the institution, while the second type indicates the magnitude of risks to the institution's viability to be applied to the four SREP elements and overall SREP score. These guidelines do not suggest any automatic link between the scores and the level of supervisory response, nor do they link additional own funds requirements to the scores.

PARAGRAPH_83464: Competent authorities should reflect in the SREP assessment available information and outcomes from other supervisory activities, including on-site inspections, approvals of internal models, authorisation approvals, outcomes of supervisory stress testing, assessment of recovery and resolution plans, market conduct and consumer protection activities, AML/CFT activities, etc. Likewise, the findings from the SREP assessment should inform other supervisory processes. Such cross-utilisation of findings from various activities to inform each other allows for truly integrated analysis and supervision of institutions, enhancing overall supervisory overview of institutions, their viability and risks, as well as maximises synergies in various areas of assessments.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:13]
PARAGRAPH_83465: These guidelines also identify the relevant building blocks required for an effective supervisory stress testing programme. They focus on different forms of supervisory stress testing and objectives, the respective use for SREP purposes, aspects related to the organisation, resources and communication, and possible methodologies. In particular, the supervisory stress testing section complements the assessment on capital adequacy by further clarifying and operationalising procedures for setting P2G and P2G-LR.

PARAGRAPH_83467: These guidelines provide common guidance on how to factor in the anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism AML/CFT-related aspects into the SREP. Such common guidance is important in view of the fact that failure to address money laundering and terrorist financing risks by institutions can have detrimental effects on the financial soundness of these institutions, the integrity of the internal market and financial stability as a whole. Therefore prudential supervisors should consider, to the extent known to them, ML/TF risks from a prudential

PARAGRAPH_83473: The requirement for institutions to have in place policies, controls and procedures to mitigate and manage effectively the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing, is set out in Directive (EU) 2015/849. Consequently, AML/CFT supervisors are responsible for supervising the institutions' compliance with those requirements, in accordance with the risk-based approach, including that the policies, controls and procedures, which have been put in place by institutions are sufficiently robust to mitigate the ML/TF risks to which they are exposed. In addition, AML/CFT supervisors are also required to carry out their own ML/TF risk assessments of the sector and also individual institutions within the sector.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:14] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_83474: Prudential competent authorities are tasked, within the SREP, with reviewing the arrangements, strategies, processes and mechanisms implemented by the institutions to comply with Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and evaluate, inter alia, the risks to which the institution is or might be exposed. In view of the specific mandate and expertise of AML/CFT supervisors, which is not expected to be duplicated by prudential supervisors, the input of AML/CFT supervisors into the SREP with regard to ML/TF risks and how effectively they are managed by institutions is important. In addition to the information available to them, prudential competent authorities should also consider information concerning ML/TF risk and other relevant input received from the AML/CFT supervisors to the extent that it affects compliance with the requirements under Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Conversely, deficiencies in governance requirements, uncovered by the prudential competent authorities, may also imply deficiencies in the AML/CFT policies, controls and procedures, which may be relevant for AML/CFT supervision and therefore cooperation between the AML/CFT and prudential supervisors is crucial.

PARAGRAPH_83475: SREP is one example where the information from AML/CFT supervision may also be beneficial for prudential supervisors and vice versa. Therefore, the outcomes of the relevant ML/TF risk assessments or findings from inspections conducted by AML/CFT supervisors should feed into the SREP, where they relate to requirements assessed by the competent authorities under Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. In the meantime, where the SREP assessment of business models, operational risk, credit risk, liquidity and funding and internal governance and institution-wide controls reveals information related to the institutions' exposure to increased ML/TF risks or the management of the ML/TF risk by institutions, the relevant information should be shared with AML/CFT supervisors to inform the supervision of the requirements under Directive (EU) 2015/849, including the imposition of AML/CFT supervisory measures or sanctions.

PARAGRAPH_83641: 26. Competent authorities should continuously assess the risk profile of the institution and its viability through the overall SREP assessment as specified in Title 10. Through the overall SREP assessment, competent authorities should determine the potential for risks to cause the failure of the institution given the adequacy of its own funds and liquidity resources, governance, controls and/or business model or strategy, and from this, the need to take early intervention measures, and/or determine whether the institution can be considered to be failing or likely to fail.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:28]

PARAGRAPH_83648: 29. Following the minimum engagement model, as specified in Section 2.4, competent authorities should engage in dialogue with institutions to assess individual SREP elements, as provided in the element-specific titles.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:28]
PARAGRAPH_83649: 30. Based on the overall SREP assessment and building on assessments of the individual SREP elements, competent authorities should take supervisory measures as specified in Title 10. Supervisory measures in these guidelines are grouped as follows:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_83654: 31. Where findings from the monitoring of key indicators, assessment of SREP elements or any other supervisory activity necessitate the application of supervisory measures to address immediate concerns, competent authorities should not wait for the completion of the assessment of all SREP elements and update of the overall SREP assessment, but decide on the measures required to rectify the situation assessed, and then proceed with updating the overall SREP assessment.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29]
PARAGRAPH_83655: 32. Competent authorities should also engage in dialogue based on the outcomes of the overall SREP assessment, alongside associated supervisory measures, and inform the institution at the end of the process about supervisory measures with which it is obliged to comply as outlined in Section 2.4.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29]
PARAGRAPH_83656: 2.2 Scoring in the SREP

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29]
PARAGRAPH_83657: 33. Competent authorities should assign risk and viability scores to summarise the outcomes of the assessment of various risk categories and elements in the SREP framework.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29]
PARAGRAPH_83658: 34. In the assessment of the individual risk categories and SREP elements, competent authorities should use a range of scores - 1 (low risk), 2 (medium-low risk), 3 (medium-high risk), and 4 (high risk) - reflecting the supervisory view based on the relevant scoring tables in each element-specific title. Competent authorities should use the accompanying 'considerations' provided in these tables for guidance to support supervisory judgement (i.e. it is not necessary for the institution to fulfil all the 'considerations' linked to a score of '1' to achieve a score of '1'), and/or further develop them or add additional considerations. Competent authorities should assign a score of '4' to reflect the worst possible assessment (i.e. even if the institution's position is worse than that envisaged by the 'considerations' for a score of '4', a score of '4' should still be assigned).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29]
PARAGRAPH_83659: 35. In their implementation of the guidelines, competent authorities may introduce more granular scoring for their internal purposes, such as planning of resources, provided that the overall scoring framework set out in these guidelines is respected.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_83660: 36. Competent authorities should ensure that all scores are regularly reviewed, at least with the frequency defined in Section 2.4 and without undue delay on the basis of material new findings or developments.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29] [RISK:LIQUIDITY_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_83662: 37. Competent authorities should assign risk scores to individual risks to capital in accordance with the criteria specified in Title 6, and scores to risks to liquidity and funding in accordance with the criteria specified in Title 8. These scores represent the likelihood that a risk will have a significant prudential impact on the institution (e.g. potential loss), after considering the quality

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:30]
PARAGRAPH_83664: of risk controls to mitigate this impact (i.e. residual risk), but before consideration of the institution's ability to mitigate the risk through available capital or liquidity resources.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:30]
PARAGRAPH_83665: 38. Competent authorities should determine the risk score predominantly through an assessment of inherent risk, but they should also reflect considerations about risk management and controls. In particular, the adequacy of management and controls may increase or - in some cases - reduce the risk of significant prudential impact (i.e. considerations relating to inherent risk may under- or overestimate the level of risk depending on the adequacy of management and controls). The assessment of inherent risk and the adequacy of management and controls should be made with reference to the considerations specified in Tables 4 to 7 and 9 and 10.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:30]
PARAGRAPH_83666: 39. In implementing these guidelines, competent authorities may use different methods to decide on individual risk scores. Inherent risk levels and the quality of risk management and controls may be scored separately (resulting in an intermediate and final score) or in aggregate. Competent authorities may also introduce aggregation methodologies for aggregating individual risks to capital and liquidity and funding scores.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:30]
PARAGRAPH_83673: 41. For capital adequacy and liquidity adequacy, these scores represent the supervisory view of the capacity of the institution's capital and liquidity resources to mitigate/cover individual risks to capital and liquidity and funding, as set out in Titles 6 and 8, and /or other elements for which additional own funds have been determined as set out in Title 7.

PARAGRAPH_83770: 54. Where competent authorities determine that institutions have similar risk profiles, they may conduct thematic SREP assessments on multiple institutions as a single assessment (e.g. a BMA may be conducted on all small mortgage lenders given that it is likely to identify the same business viability issues for all these institutions). Competent authorities may also use tailored methodologies for the application of the SREP for institutions with similar risk profiles, such as similar business models or geographical location of exposures in accordance with Article 97(4a) of Directive 2013/36/EU.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:35]
PARAGRAPH_83771: 55. Competent authorities should determine an additional level of engagement based on the findings from previous assessments of one or more SREP elements, whereby more extensive supervisory resources and a higher intensity and frequency of engagement should be required, tailored to the situation of the individual institution in terms of risks and vulnerabilities, regardless of the category of the institution, for institutions with a poor overall SREP score (at least on a temporary basis).

PARAGRAPH_83776: 58. For the scope of proportionality, when conducting the SREP by applying these guidelines, competent authorities should recognise that different elements, methodological aspects and assessment components as provided in Titles 4, 5, 6 and 8 do not have the same relevance for all institutions; competent authorities should, where relevant, apply different degrees of granularity to the assessment depending on the category to which the institution is assigned and to the extent appropriate for the size and business model of the institution, and the nature, scale and complexity of its activities.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:36]
PARAGRAPH_83777: 59. Having regard to paragraphs 57 and 58, competent authorities may also determine the specific focus of SREP, where more detailed assessment is carried out in selected areas, while less scrutiny, but sufficient for meaningful assessment, is devoted to all other SREP elements. Such a focus of SREP may be based on multi-year planning, economic circumstances or specific situation of an institution. In determining the focus and granularity of the assessment, competent authorities should take into account the risk profile of the institution, the materiality of the different risks and any changes thereof, including those observed in the monitoring of key indicators as outlined in Title 3, stress testing as outlined in Title 12 or in the outcome of previous SREP assessments.

Competent authorities should engage in regular monitoring of key financial and non-financial indicators to monitor changes in the financial conditions and risk profiles of institutions. Competent authorities should also use this monitoring to identify the need for updates to the assessment of SREP elements in light of new material information outside of planned supervisory activities. Where monitoring reveals a material change in the risk profile of the institution, or any anomalies in the indicators, competent authorities should investigate the causes, and, where relevant, review the assessment of the relevant SREP element in light of the new information.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:37]
PARAGRAPH_83783: 63. Competent authorities should tailor the set of indicators and their thresholds to the specific features of individual institutions or groups of institutions with similar characteristics (peer groups).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:39]
PARAGRAPH_83803: 70. This title specifies criteria for the assessment of the business model and strategy of the institution. Competent authorities should apply this assessment to an institution at the same level as the overall SREP assessment, but it can also be applied at business or product-line level, or on a thematic basis.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:39] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_83804: 71. Without undermining the responsibility of the institution's management body for running and organising the business, or indicating preferences for specific business models, competent authorities should conduct regular business model analysis (BMA) to assess business and strategic risks and determine:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:39]
PARAGRAPH_83805: the viability of the institution's current business model on the basis of its ability to generate acceptable returns over the following 12 months; and

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:39]
PARAGRAPH_83806: the sustainability of the institution's strategy on the basis of its ability to generate acceptable returns over a forward-looking period of at least 3 years, based on its strategic plans and financial forecasts.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:39] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_83807: 72. Competent authorities should use the outcome of the BMA to support the assessment of all other elements of the SREP. Competent authorities may assess specific aspects of the BMA, in particular the quantitative assessment of the business model, as part of the assessment of other SREP elements (e.g. understanding the funding structure can be part of the risks to liquidity assessment).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:39]
PARAGRAPH_83808: 73. Competent authorities should also use the BMA to support the identification of the institution's key vulnerabilities, which are most likely to have a material impact on the institution/lead to its failure in the future.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:39] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_83809: 74. Competent authorities should also use the BMA to assess prudential implications of ML/TF risks known to them, linked to the business model of the institution. In this respect, competent authorities should use the input received from AML/CFT supervisors, in particular their assessments of ML/TF risks and any findings relating to material weaknesses in an institution's AML/CFT controls, to complement their findings from ongoing supervision, and evaluate whether they give rise to prudential concerns related to ML/TF risk. Where the assessment indicates the business model of the institution gives rise to prudential concerns related to ML/TF risk, competent authorities should share the outcome of the prudential assessment of the business model with the AML/CFT supervisors17.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:41]
PARAGRAPH_83844: a. determine materiality of business areas/lines: competent authorities should determine which geographies, subsidiaries/branches, business lines and product lines are the most material based on profit contribution (e.g. based on P&L), risk (e.g. based on TREA or other measures of risk) and/or organisational/statutory priorities (e.g. specific obligations for public sector banks to offer specific products). Competent authorities should use this information as a basis for identifying what the BMA should focus on (covered further in Section 4.3);

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:41]
PARAGRAPH_83845: b. identify the peer group: competent authorities should determine the relevant peer group for the institution; to conducting a BMA, the competent authority should determine the peer group on the basis of the rival product/business lines targeting the same source of profits/customers (e.g. the credit-card businesses of different institutions targeting credit card users in country X);

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_84136: 131. When assessing stress testing programmes, the results of stress tests and proposed management actions, competent authorities should consider both idiosyncratic and system- wide perspectives. In particular, management actions should be primarily assessed from an internal perspective with regard to their plausibility, considering the specificities of an individual institution. Competent authorities should also consider management actions from a system-wide perspective, as other institutions are likely to consider similar actions, which in a system-wide context may be implausible.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_84137: 132. When assessing management actions with an effect on an institution's capital or general financial position, competent authorities should consider their feasibility in stress situations and the timelines for the implementation of the action. In particular, management actions should be completed and implemented during the time horizon of the stress test. Competent authorities may also consider, where relevant, management actions that will be completed later than the time horizon of the stress test.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_84138: 133. Competent authorities should take into account the effectiveness of institutions' stress testing programmes in identifying relevant business vulnerabilities and take this into consideration when assessing institutions' business model viability and sustainability of their strategies (see Title 4).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_84139: 134. When assessing stress testing programmes and their results in the case of cross-border groups, competent authorities should consider the transferability of capital and liquidity between the legal entities or business units during stressed conditions, as well as the functioning of any established intra-group financial support arrangements, taking into account the funding difficulties that might be expected in stressed conditions.

PARAGRAPH_84146: d. the impact of the assumptions on the outputs of stress tests.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:65]
PARAGRAPH_84147: 136. When challenging scenarios, assumptions and the outcomes of institutions' stress tests, competent authorities should use, where appropriate, the outcomes, scenarios and assumptions from supervisory stress tests, including relevant regional stress test exercises done by various authorities, such as the EBA, the IMF and the ESCB/ESRB, as well the qualitative assessment as specified above, to determine the extent to which the institution's stress testing programme and its outcomes can be relied on.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:65]
PARAGRAPH_84148: 137. If competent authorities identify deficiencies in the design of the scenarios or assumptions used by institutions, they may require institutions to rerun their stress tests, or some specific parts of the stress testing programme using modified assumptions provided by the competent authorities, or specific prescribed scenarios (e.g. the anchor scenarios defined in the EBA Guidelines on institutions' stress testing).

PARAGRAPH_84149: 138. Competent authorities should assess the results of stress tests, in particular with regard to stress tests performed in the context of capital and liquidity risk management, including the ones for ICAAP and ILAAP purposes (see also Section 5.7.2) and they should ensure that in a stress scenario used for capital adequacy purposes the capital ratio is negatively affected as the result of, for example, credit rating migrations, a reduction in net interest margins or trading losses.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:65] [RISK:LIQUIDITY_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_84150: 139. In their reviews of stress tests performed in the context of capital and liquidity risk management, including for ICAAP and ILAAP purposes, competent authorities should carry out a combined assessment of the impact of stress test outcomes on capital and liquidity needs, as well as on other relevant regulatory requirements. To that end, competent authorities should assess whether the institution is able to maintain the applicable TSCR, at all times, in an adverse scenario and if it has identified a set of management actions to address any potential breaches of TSCR.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:65]
PARAGRAPH_84151: 140. Competent authorities should also consider the impact of stress tests on an institution's leverage ratio, as well as its eligible liabilities held for the purposes of minimum requirements for eligible liabilities (MREL) as referred to in Directive 2014/59/EU.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:66]
PARAGRAPH_84153: 141. In the assessment of stress test results, competent authorities should also consider all known future regulatory changes affecting institutions within the scope and time horizon of the stress test exercise. Likewise, competent authorities should also consider all known changes in future capital requirements (e.g. fully loaded assessments) when assessing stress test results and business-model viability.

PARAGRAPH_84158: 144. . In line with the EBA Guidelines on internal governance and the EBA Guidelines on ICT and security risk management24, competent authorities should assess whether the institution's information and communication technologies are effective and reliable and whether these systems fully support risk data aggregation capabilities at normal times, as well as during times of stress. In particular, competent authorities should assess whether the institution is at least able to:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:67]
PARAGRAPH_84168: 146. When analysing the internal governance framework and institution-wide controls, competent authorities should also take into account the assessments received from AML/CFT supervisors, and evaluate whether these give rise to prudential concerns. This could be the case in particular where findings point to material weaknesses in an institution's AML/CFT systems and controls. Conversely, where the competent authority's assessment indicates the shortcomings in an institution's internal controls and governance framework and institution- wide controls give rise to prudential concerns related to ML/TF risk, competent authorities should share the outcome of that assessment with AML/CFT supervisors25.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:67] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]

PARAGRAPH_84241: 157. The title also identifies a set of subcategories within each risk category above, which need to be taken into account when risks to capital are assessed. Depending on the materiality of any these subcategories to a particular institution, they can be assessed and scored individually.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:74]
PARAGRAPH_84242: 158. The decision on materiality depends on the supervisory judgement. However, for FX lending risk, in light of the ESRB Recommendation on lending in foreign currencies29, materiality should be determined taking into account the following threshold:

PARAGRAPH_84254: 161. For credit, market and operational risk, competent authorities should verify the institution's compliance with the minimum requirements specified in the relevant EU and national implementing legislation. However, these guidelines extend the scope of the assessment beyond those minimum requirements to allow competent authorities to form a comprehensive view on risks to capital.

PARAGRAPH_84269: 166. When performing their assessments, competent authorities should use all available information sources, including regulatory reporting, ad hoc reporting agreed with the institution, the institution's internal metrics and reports (e.g. internal audit report, risk management reports, information from the ICAAP), on-site inspection reports and external reports (e.g. the institution's communications to investors, rating agencies). While the assessment is intended to be institution-specific, comparison with peers should be considered to identify potential exposure to risks to capital. For such purposes, peers should be defined on a risk-by-risk basis and might differ from those identified for BMA or other analyses.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:76]
PARAGRAPH_84270: 167. . In the assessment of risks to capital, competent authorities should also evaluate the accuracy and prudency of the calculation of minimum own fund requirements to identify situations where minimum own funds calculations may underestimate the actual level of risk. This assessment would inform the determination of additional own funds requirements as provided in Section 7.2.3.

PARAGRAPH_84274: 169. Competent authorities should assess credit risk arising from all banking book exposures (including off-balance sheet items). They should also assess the counterparty credit risk and the settlement risk that could fall under both banking and trading books.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:76] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_84275: 170. In assessing credit risk, competent authorities should consider all the components that determine potential credit losses, and in particular: the probability of a credit event (i.e. default), or correlated credit events, that mainly concerns the borrowers and their ability to repay relevant obligations; the size of exposures subject to credit risk; and the recovery rate of

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:77]
PARAGRAPH_84277: the credit exposures in the event of borrowers defaulting. For all these components, competent authorities should take into account the possibility that these components may deteriorate over time and worsen compared to expected outcomes.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:77]
PARAGRAPH_84278: 171. In addition, competent authorities should also pay attention to whether ML/TF risks are considered within the context of the credit-granting process, including whether the institution has systems and controls in place to ensure funds used to repay loans are from legitimate sources in accordance with the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring.30

PARAGRAPH_84280: 172. Through the assessment of inherent credit risk, competent authorities should determine the main drivers of the institution's credit risk exposure and evaluate the significance of the prudential impact of this risk for the institution. The assessment of inherent credit risk should therefore be structured around the following main steps:

PARAGRAPH_84286: 173. Competent authorities should assess credit risk in both current and prospective terms. Competent authorities should combine the analysis of the current portfolio's credit risk with the assessment of the institution's credit risk strategy, credit risk appetite and credit risk limits (potentially as part of the wider assessment of strategy carried out as part of the BMA). Competent authorities should also consider how the expected, as well as the stressed, macroeconomic developments could affect those elements and ultimately the institution's earnings and own funds.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:77]
PARAGRAPH_84287: 174. Competent authorities should primarily conduct the assessment at both portfolio and asset-class level. Where relevant, competent authorities should also conduct a more granular assessment, potentially at the level of single borrowers or transactions. Competent authorities may also use sampling techniques when assessing portfolio risk.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:77]
PARAGRAPH_84288: 175. Competent authorities may perform the assessment vertically (i.e. by considering all the dimensions for relevant sub-portfolios) or horizontally (i.e. by considering one dimension, for example credit quality, for the overall portfolio).

PARAGRAPH_84292: 176. To determine the scope of the assessment of credit risk, competent authorities should first identify the sources of credit risk to which the institution is or may be exposed. To do so, competent authorities should leverage the knowledge gained from the assessment of other SREP elements, from the comparison of the institution's position to peers and from any other supervisory activities.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:78]
PARAGRAPH_84293: 177. As a minimum, competent authorities should consider the following:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:78] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_84302: 180. Competent authorities should assess the nature of the credit exposures (i.e. the types of borrowers and exposures) to identify the underlying risk factors and they should analyse the composition of the institution's credit portfolio. Competent authorities should perform this analysis in both current and prospective terms, in light of the general macroeconomic situation.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:78] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_84303: 181. In performing this assessment, competent authorities should also consider how the nature of credit risk exposure can affect the size of exposure (e.g. credit lines/undrawn commitments drawn down by borrowers, foreign currency denomination, etc.), taking into consideration the institution's legal capacity to unilaterally cancel undrawn amounts of committed credit facilities.

PARAGRAPH_84316: 183. Competent authorities should form a view on the degree of credit concentration risk, as referred to in Article 81 of Directive 2013/36/EU, to which the institution is exposed. Specifically, competent authorities should assess the risk that the institution will incur significant credit losses stemming from a concentration of exposures to a small group of borrowers, to a set of borrowers with similar default behaviour or to highly correlated financial assets.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:79] [RISK:CONCENTRATION_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_84317: 184. Competent authorities should conduct this assessment by considering different categories of credit concentration risk, including:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:79]
PARAGRAPH_84318: a. single-name concentrations (including a client or group of connected clients as defined for large exposures);

PARAGRAPH_84322: e. collateral and guarantees concentration.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:80] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_84324: 185. To identify credit concentrations, competent authorities should consider the common drivers of credit risk across exposures and should focus on those exposures that tend to exhibit similar behaviour (i.e. high correlation).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:80] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK] [RISK:CONCENTRATION_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_84325: 186. Competent authorities should pay particular attention to hidden sources of credit concentration risk that can materialise under stressed conditions, when the level of credit risk correlation can increase compared to normal conditions and when additional credit exposures can arise from off-balance sheet items.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:80] [RISK:CONCENTRATION_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_84326: 187. For groups, competent authorities should consider the credit concentration risk that can result from consolidation, which may be not evident at an individual level.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:80]
PARAGRAPH_84327: 188. When assessing credit concentrations, competent authorities should consider the possibility of overlaps (e.g. a high concentration to a specific government will probably lead to a country concentration and single-name concentration), and should therefore avoid applying a simple aggregation of the different types of credit concentration, and should instead consider underlying drivers.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:80] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_84328: 189. To assess the level of concentration, competent authorities can use different measures and indicators, the most common being the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) and Gini coefficients, which may then be included in more or less complex methodologies to estimate the additional credit risk impact.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:98]
PARAGRAPH_84602: Preliminary assessment

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:98] [RISK:MARKET_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_84603: 241. To determine the scope of the assessment of market risk, competent authorities should first identify the sources of market risk to which the institution is or may be exposed. To do so, competent authorities should leverage the knowledge gained from the assessment of other SREP elements, from the comparison of the institution's position to peers and from any other supervisory activities.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:98]
PARAGRAPH_84604: 242. As a minimum, competent authorities should consider:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:99] [RISK:MARKET_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_84616: 244. Competent authorities should analyse the nature of the institution's market risk exposures by considering the subcategories defined in paragraph 238 to identify particular risk exposures and related market risk factors/drivers (e.g. exchange rates, interest rates or credit spreads) for further in-depth assessment.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:99] [RISK:MARKET_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_84617: 245. Competent authorities should analyse market risk exposures by relevant asset classes and/or financial instruments according to their size, complexity and level of risk. For the most relevant exposures, competent authorities should assess their related risk factors and drivers.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:99] [RISK:MARKET_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_84618: 246. While analysing market risk activities, competent authorities should also consider the complexity of the financial products (e.g. over-the-counter (OTC) products or products valued using mark-to-model techniques) and of specific market operations (e.g. high-frequency trading). The following points should be considered:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:99] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_84619: a. if the institution holds derivatives positions, competent authorities should assess both the market value and the notional amount; and

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:99] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_84620: b. when the institution is engaged in OTC derivatives, competent authorities should evaluate the weight of these transactions in the total derivatives portfolio and the breakdown of the OTC portfolio by type of contract (swap, forward, etc.), underlying financial instruments, etc. (the counterparty credit risk associated with these products is covered under the credit risk methodology).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:100] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_84622: 247. When appropriate, competent authorities should assess the institution's evaluation of distressed and/or illiquid positions (e.g. 'legacy portfolios', i.e. portfolios of illiquid assets related to the discontinued banking practices/activities that are managed on a run-off model) and the impact of such positions on the institution's profitability.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:100]
PARAGRAPH_84623: 248. For those institutions using the internal model approach (IMA) to calculate their regulatory own funds requirements, competent authorities should also consider the following indicators to identify particular risk areas and related risk drivers:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:100] [RISK:MARKET_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_84624: a. the split of market risk own funds requirements between the value at risk (VaR), stressed VaR (SVaR), incremental risk charge (IRC) and charge for correlation trading portfolio;

PARAGRAPH_84629: f. where relevant, the results of the calculations performed for the purpose of the specific reporting requirements for market risk, based on using the alternative internal model approach (IMA) set out in Chapter 1b of Title IV of Part Three of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:100] [RISK:MARKET_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_84630: 249. When appropriate, competent authorities should also consider the internal risk measures of institutions. These could include the internal VaR or expected shortfall not used in the calculations of own funds requirements or sensitivities of the market risk to different risk factors and potential losses.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:100] [RISK:MARKET_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_84631: 250. When analysing inherent market risk, competent authorities should consider 'point-in- time' figures and trends, both on an aggregate basis and by portfolio. Where possible, this analysis should be completed with a comparison of the institution's figures to peers and to relevant macroeconomic indicators.

PARAGRAPH_84632: Profitability analysis

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:100] [RISK:MARKET_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_84633: 251. Competent authorities should analyse the historic profitability, including volatility of profits, of market activities to gain a better understanding of the institution's market risk profile. This analysis could be performed at portfolio level as well as being broken down by

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:101]
PARAGRAPH_84635: business line, asset class or desk (potentially as part of the wider assessment carried out as part of the BMA).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:101] [RISK:MARKET_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_84636: 252. While assessing profitability, competent authorities should pay specific attention to the main risk areas identified during the examination of market risk activities. Competent authorities should distinguish between trading revenues and non-trading revenues (such as commissions, clients' fees, etc.) on one hand and realised and unrealised profits/losses on the other hand.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:101] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_84637: 253. For those asset classes and/or exposures generating abnormal profits or losses, competent authorities should assess profitability in comparison to the level of risk assumed by the institution (e.g. VaR/net gains on financial assets and liabilities held for trading) to identify and analyse possible inconsistencies. Where possible, competent authorities should compare the institution's figures to its historical performance and its peers.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:101] [RISK:CONCENTRATION_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_84638: Market concentration risk

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:101] [RISK:CONCENTRATION_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_84639: 254. Competent authorities should form a view on the degree of market concentration risk to which the institution is exposed, either from exposures to a single risk factor or from exposures to multiple risk factors that are correlated.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:101]
PARAGRAPH_84640: 255. When evaluating possible concentrations, competent authorities should pay special attention to concentrations in complex products (e.g. structured products), illiquid products (e.g. collateralised debt obligations (CDOs)) or products valued using mark-to-model techniques.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:101]
PARAGRAPH_84641: Stress testing

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:101] [RISK:MARKET_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_84642: 256. When evaluating the inherent market risk of an institution, competent authorities should take into account the results of stress tests performed by the institution to identify any previously unidentified sources of market risk. This is especially important for tail-risk events, which may be underrepresented or entirely absent from historical data because of their low frequency of occurrence. Another source of potential hidden vulnerabilities that competent authorities should consider is the potential for jumps in pricing parameters, such as a sudden change in certain prices or price bubbles in commodities.

PARAGRAPH_84763: .72. Competent authorities should assess operational risk throughout all the business lines and operations of the institution, taking into account findings from the assessment of internal governance arrangements and institution-wide controls as specified in Title 5. In conducting this assessment, they should determine how operational risk may materialise (economic loss, near miss, loss of future earnings, gain) and should also consider potential impacts in terms of other related risks (e.g. credit-operational risk, market-operational risk 'boundary cases').

PARAGRAPH_84765: 74. When assessing operational risk, competent authorities should assess ICT risk, as ICT performance and security are considered paramount for an institution to conduct its business. Thus, competent authorities should assess potential impact of ICT risks on the critical activities of an institution and consider the potential financial, reputational, regulatory and strategic impact on the institution as well as the potential for business disruption.

Competent authorities should assess reputational risk jointly with operational risk because of the strong links between the two (e.g. most operational risk events have a strong impact in terms of reputation). However, the outcome of reputational risk assessment should not be reflected in the scoring of operational risk but, where relevant, should be considered as part of the BMA and/or the liquidity risk assessment, since the main effects it can have are reductions

PARAGRAPH_84771: 277. Competent authorities should conduct an assessment of the nature and the extent of the operational risk to which the institution is or might be exposed. To this end, competent authorities should develop a thorough understanding of the institution's business model, its operations, its risk culture and the environment in which it operates, since all these factors determine the institution's operational risk exposure.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:112] [RISK:OPERATIONAL_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_84793: 82. Competent authorities should determine the nature of operational risk exposures by analysing exposures to the main drivers of operational risk to form a forward-looking view on potential risk and losses. Such an analysis may require consideration of business lines, products, processes and geographies relevant to the institution, as well as an assessment of operational risk exposures to primary risk drivers (e.g. processes, people, systems and external factors), with use of the institution's self-risk assessment and peer analysis.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:112] [RISK:OPERATIONAL_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_84794: 283. In performing this analysis, competent authorities should consider the interactions of such risk drivers in determining the institution's operational risk exposures (e.g. exposure to more risk drivers might increase the likelihood of an operational event and consequent loss, including the possibility to impose sanctions).

PARAGRAPH_84796: 284. Once the major sources and drivers of operational risk have been identified, the competent authority should focus on those that might have the most material impact on the institution. The competent authority should assess the institution's 'potential exposure' to the operational risk by using both expert judgement and qualitative and quantitative indicators relating to either the institution or its peers, and also include information from other supervisors (e.g. AML/CFT supervisors).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:112] [RISK:OPERATIONAL_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_84797: 285. In assessing the significance of operational risk exposures, competent authorities should consider both the frequency and the severity of the events to which the institution is exposed, and distinguish those causing high-severity losses and those occurring with high frequencies. Based on this distinction, competent authorities should assess the trends of operational risk losses and their concentration.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:112] [RISK:OPERATIONAL_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_84798: 286. A primary source of information competent authorities should consider is the institution's operational losses and event database, which, where available and reliable (i.e. accurate and complete), provides the historical operational risk profile of the institution.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:113] [RISK:OPERATIONAL_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_84800: 287. For institutions adopting internal models for operational risk, the competent authority should also consider the output of the internal approach, provided that this approach is capable of measuring the operational risk exposure in the desired level of detail (e.g. product, process, etc.) and assuming that the model is sufficiently forward-looking. However, competent authorities should also take into account the limitations and potential weaknesses of the internal models.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:113] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_84801: 288. In addition, competent authorities should perform a more qualitative analysis and leverage the institution's risk assessment, peer analysis data and public and/or consortium databases, if available and relevant. Competent authorities may also consider other factors, specific to the relevant business units, etc. affected by the potential deficiencies, which can provide a measure of the risk exposure.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:113]
PARAGRAPH_84802: 289. In performing the assessment of an institution's risk exposure, competent authorities should employ a forward-looking approach, leveraging scenario analyses performed by the institution, where available, and taking into consideration any corrective measures and mitigation actions already implemented and effective.

PARAGRAPH_84804: 290. Competent authorities should identify and assess operational risk across all operational risk subcategories (including those defined by event types and further breakdowns of these event types) and the associated risk drivers. Competent authorities should focus the assessment on those subcategories, which are considered the most significant for the institution. The significance of a subcategory should be evaluated by leveraging the quantitative information collected during the preliminary assessment, including the level of losses per subcategory with regard to capital requirement and gross income. Competent authorities should also apply their expert judgement to identify significant subcategories, based on all available internal and external information sources.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:113] [RISK:OPERATIONAL_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_84805: 291. In conducting the assessment, competent authorities should pay particular attention to some specific aspects of operational risk because of their pervasive nature and their relevance to the majority of institutions, and also because of their potential prudential impact. Such aspects which should always be in the focus of assessment include:

PARAGRAPH_84821: 294. Since conduct risk covers a wide range of issues and may arise from many business processes and products, competent authorities should leverage the outcome of the BMA and scrutinise incentive policies to gain a high-level insight into sources of conduct risk.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:114]
PARAGRAPH_84822: 295. Where relevant, the competent authority should consider the level of competition in the markets in which the institution operates and determine whether any dominant position, either alone or within a small group, presents a material risk of misconduct (e.g. as a result of cartel- like behaviour).

PARAGRAPH_84847: 303. Competent authorities should assess the reputational risk to which the institution is exposed, by leveraging their understanding of the institution's governance, its business model, its products, its customer base and the environment in which it operates. Such an assessment should also focus on the overall reputational risk framework, ensuring the ability of the institution to manage and mitigate any reputation events through appropriate communication strategies.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:116] [RISK:REPUTATIONAL_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_84848: 304. Reputational risk is more relevant for large institutions, in particular those with listed equities or debts or those that operate in interbank markets. Accordingly, when assessing reputational risk, competent authorities should pay more attention to institutions that present those characteristics.

PARAGRAPH_84985: 327. Competent authorities should assess interest rate risk arising from interest rate-sensitive positions from non-trading on and off-balance sheet activities (commonly referred to as interest rate risk in the non-trading book, or IRRBB), including hedges for these positions, irrespective of their recognition and measurement, and irrespective of the recognition and measurement of losses and gains, for accounting purposes.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:128]
PARAGRAPH_85016: 335. Competent authorities should form a clear view on how changes in interest rates can have an adverse impact on an institution's net interest income (and, where relevant, its earnings) and economic value (the present value of expected cash flows) to gain both a short-term and a longer-term view on the possible threat to capital adequacy.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:129]
PARAGRAPH_85018: 336. For this purpose, competent authorities should analyse and form a clear view on the structure of the institution's assets, liabilities and, where available, off-balance-sheet exposures. In particular:

PARAGRAPH_85023: 337. To better determine the complexity and the interest rate risk profile of the institution, competent authorities should also understand the main features of the institution's assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet exposures, in particular:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:129]
PARAGRAPH_85024: a. loan portfolio (e.g. volume of loans with no maturity, volume of loans with pre- payment options, volume of floating-rate loans with caps and floors, share of floating rate loan contracts that prevent repricing at negative rates, etc.);

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:129]
PARAGRAPH_85030: 338. When analysing the impact on the institution's earnings, competent authorities should consider the institution's different sources of income and expenses and their relative weights to total revenues. They should be aware of how much the institution's returns depend on interest rate-sensitive positions, and they should determine how different changes in interest rates would affect the institution's net interest income, as well as determining the effects of changes in the market value of instruments - depending on accounting treatment - either

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:130]
PARAGRAPH_85033: 339. When analysing the impact on the institution's economic value and earnings, competent authorities should first consider the results of the supervisory outlier tests stipulated in Article 98(5) of Directive 2013/36/EU and further specified in the delegated regulation adopted in accordance with Article 98(5a) of that Directive, to get an initial benchmark against which to compare how interest rate changes would affect the institution. When performing this assessment, competent authorities should pay particular attention to the sensitivity of cash flows to repricing, in terms of both their timing and amount, to changes in the underlying key assumptions (particularly for customer accounts without specific repricing dates, customer accounts with embedded customer optionality and/or equity capital).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:130]
PARAGRAPH_85034: 340. Competent authorities should seek to understand the impact of those assumptions and then isolate the economic value and earnings risks arising from the institution's behavioural adjustments.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:130]
PARAGRAPH_85035: 341. Competent authorities should pay attention to the sensitivity of cash flows to changes in the valuation of fair value instruments in the non-trading book, including interest rate derivatives used for the hedging of non-trading book instruments (e.g. impact of mark-to- market changes in fair value instruments on P&L, hedge account effectiveness).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:130]
PARAGRAPH_85036: 342. In addition to using the supervisory outlier test stipulated in Article 98(5) of Directive 2013/36/EU and further specified in the delegated regulation adopted in accordance with Article 98(5a) of that Directive competent authorities may require institutions to take into account other interest rate shock scenarios.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:130]
PARAGRAPH_85037: 343. In their quantitative assessment, competent authorities should also consider the results of the institution's internal or standardised methodologies for measuring IRRBB, where appropriate. Through the analysis of these methodologies, competent authorities should gain a deeper understanding of the main risk factors underlying the institution's IRRBB profile.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:130] [RISK:MARKET_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_85038: 344. Competent authorities should assess whether those institutions operating in different currencies perform an analysis of the interest rate risk in each currency in which they have a significant position. Competent authorities should also assess the approaches that these institutions use for the purpose of aggregating the results of economic value and earnings measures in individual currencies.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:130]
PARAGRAPH_85039: 345. When analysing the results of both the impact of the supervisory outlier tests and the institution's internal or standardised methodologies, competent authorities should consider 'point in time' figures as well as historical trends. These rates should be compared to peers and considered in the context of the global market situation.

PARAGRAPH_85042: 346. Competent authorities should assess and take into account the results of the interest rate shock scenarios and stress tests (in addition to those of the supervisory outlier tests) performed by the institution as part of its ongoing internal management process. In this context, competent authorities should be aware of the main sources of the institution's IRRBB.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:131]
PARAGRAPH_85043: 347. If, when the outcome of the institution's shock scenarios and stress tests is reviewed, particular accumulations of repricing/maturity at different points on the curve are revealed or suspected, competent authorities may need to carry out additional analyses.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:139]
PARAGRAPH_85155: 360. Competent authorities should determine through the SREP capital assessment whether the own funds held by the institution provide sound coverage of risks to capital to which the institution is or might be exposed, if such risks are assessed as material to the institution.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:139] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_85156: 361. Competent authorities should do this by determining and setting the quantity (amount) and quality (composition) of additional own funds the institution is required to hold to cover institution-specific risks and elements of risks that are not covered or not sufficiently covered by Parts Three, Four and Seven of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Chapter 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 ('Pillar 1 own funds requirements'), and, where necessary, own funds requirements to address deficiencies in models, controls, governance or other deficiencies, as well as risk arising from the institution's business model ('additional own funds requirements'). Additional own funds requirements should be met by the institution at all times.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:139]
PARAGRAPH_85157: 362. To address potential capital inadequacies, including in stressed conditions, competent authorities should take appropriate supervisory measures, including, where relevant, establishing and communicating P2G which is the quantity (amount) and quality (composition) of own funds that the institution is expected to hold over and above its OCR or its OLRR.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:139]
PARAGRAPH_85158: 363. When setting the additional own funds requirements and, where relevant, guidance, competent authorities should:

PARAGRAPH_85162: 364. Competent authorities should assess the adequacy of the institution's own funds and the impact of economic stress thereon, as well as risks posed by excessive leverage, as a key determinant of the institution's viability.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:141] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_85181: 367. When setting additional own funds requirements for the risk of unexpected losses pursuant to point (a) of paragraph 366, competent authorities should consider each type of risk that may pose a material risk to the institution's capital. Competent authorities should set additional own funds required to cover the risk of unexpected losses by determining the capital considered adequate to cover the type of risk and deducting the relevant part of own funds requirements set out in Parts Three and Four of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Chapter 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:141]
PARAGRAPH_85182: 368. For the purpose of the previous paragraph, competent authorities should determine on a risk-by-risk basis, the amounts of capital considered adequate, by identifying, assessing and quantifying the risks to which the institution is exposed and they should take into account the full risk profile of an institution. The determination of the amounts of capital considered adequate should include:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:141]
PARAGRAPH_85183: a. institution-specific risks or elements of such risks that are explicitly excluded from or not explicitly addressed by the Pillar 1 own funds requirements;

PARAGRAPH_85184: b. institution-specific risks or elements of such risks that are considered not to be sufficiently covered by the applicable Pillar 1 own funds requirements.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:141] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_85185: 369. Competent authorities should ensure that the amount of capital considered adequate to cover each risk identified in accordance with Articles 79 to 85 of Directive 2013/36/EU is not lower than the relevant part of the applicable Pillar 1 own funds requirement covering that risk. In exceptional cases where it is overly burdensome, especially for small institutions, to meaningfully disentangle the amount of capital considered adequate for two or more types of risk quantified together, competent authorities should comply with the first sentence of this paragraph on a best-effort basis, using the ICAAP calculations, supervisory judgement and other sources of information, by determining the level of additional own funds requirements in a conservative manner, having regard to paragraphs 372 to 374.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:141]
PARAGRAPH_85186: 370. The identification, assessment and quantification of risks to which the institution is exposed should be supported by the following sources of information:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:141]
PARAGRAPH_85187: a. the ICAAP and the outcomes of its assessment by the competent authority, including the ICAAP calculations where deemed reliable or partially reliable in accordance with paragraphs 375 to 377;

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:141]
PARAGRAPH_85188: b. supervisory reporting;

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:141]
PARAGRAPH_85189: c. the outcome of supervisory assessment and benchmarking;

PARAGRAPH_85190: d. the outcomes of any relevant previous supervisory activities; and

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:141]
PARAGRAPH_85191: e. other relevant inputs, including those arising from interaction and dialogue with the institution.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:142]
PARAGRAPH_85193: 371. The ICAAP and outcomes of its assessment should be taken into account by competent authorities as one of the key inputs for the identification and assessment of risks relevant for the institution. The determination of the amount of capital considered adequate and additional own funds requirements on a risk-by-risk basis should take into account the ICAAP calculations if deemed reliable or partially reliable, as well as the outcomes of supervisory benchmarking and other relevant inputs as appropriate, including the supervisory judgement.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:142]
PARAGRAPH_85194: 372. Competent authorities should not allow own funds held pursuant to Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 to be used to meet or offset additional own funds requirements both on an aggregate and on a risk-by-risk basis.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:142] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_85195: 373. For the purposes of Article 98(1), point (f) of Directive 2013/36/EU and the determination of additional own funds requirements, competent authorities should assess and consider diversification effects arising from geographical, sectoral or any other relevant drivers within each material risk category (intra-risk diversification). For each of the risks to capital covered by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, such diversification effects should not reduce the minimum own funds requirements calculated in accordance with Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:142]
PARAGRAPH_85196: 374. However, diversification between risks in different categories, including those covered by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (inter-risk diversification) should not be considered as part of the determination of additional own funds requirements.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:142] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_85198: 375. Competent authorities should assess the reliability of the ICAAP calculations by assessing whether they are:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:142] [RISK:CONCENTRATION_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_85199: a. Granular: the calculations/methodologies should allow the calculations to be broken down by risk type, rather than presenting a single (economic capital) calculation covering all risks. This breakdown should be enabled by the ICAAP methodology itself. Risks should not be excluded from the ICAAP where they are difficult to quantify or where relevant data are not available; estimates may be provided based on available information and including expert judgement. Where deemed appropriate by the competent authority, estimates may be provided through marginal contribution calculations, for example, for risks that cannot be measured on a standalone basis (e.g. credit concentration risk).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:142] [RISK:CONCENTRATION_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_85200: b. Credible: the calculations/methodologies used should demonstrably cover the risk they are looking to address (e.g. the credit concentration risk calculation should use appropriate sector breakdowns that reflect actual correlations and portfolio compositions) and should be sufficiently robust, stable, risk sensitive and conservative to adequately quantify losses associated with the risks. Such

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:143]
PARAGRAPH_85202: calculations/methodologies should be consistent with the institutions' strategic processes, including the institutions' risk appetite.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:143] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_85203: c. Understandable: the underlying drivers of the calculations/methodologies should be clearly specified. A 'black box' calculation should not be acceptable. Competent authorities should ensure that the institution provides an explanation of the key assumptions used, including at least time horizon, confidence levels, correlation assumptions, key parameters, the most fallible areas of the models used, and how these are accounted for and corrected in the final ICAAP calculation.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:143]
PARAGRAPH_85204: d. Comparable: the calculations/methodologies should clearly mention the main assumptions in terms of the overall level of conservatism, the holding periods/risk horizons and confidence levels (or equivalent measurement) in order to allow the adjustment that may be requested or enacted by competent authorities in order to facilitate comparability with peers and supervisory benchmarking.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:143] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_85205: 376. Competent authorities should further assess the reliability of the ICAAP calculations by comparing them against the outcome of the supervisory benchmarks for the same risks, and other relevant inputs.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:143]
PARAGRAPH_85206: 377. An ICAAP calculation should be considered partially reliable where, despite not meeting all the above criteria, the calculation still seems highly credible, though this should be on an exceptional basis and accompanied by steps to improve deficiencies identified in the ICAAP calculation.

PARAGRAPH_85207: Supervisory benchmarks

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:143]
PARAGRAPH_85208: 378. Competent authorities should develop and apply risk-specific supervisory benchmarks as a means to challenge ICAAP calculations for those material risks, or elements of such risks, that are not covered or not sufficiently covered by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, or to further support the determination of risk-by-risk additional own funds requirement, especially where ICAAP calculations for those material risks, or elements of such risks, are deemed unreliable or are unavailable.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:143] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_85209: 379. The supervisory benchmarks should be developed to provide a prudent, consistent (i.e., as applicable, calibrated to equivalent holding periods/risk horizons and confidence levels as required by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013), transparent and comparable measure with which to calculate and compare across institutions the capital considered adequate for a given type of risk.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:143]
PARAGRAPH_85210: 380. Given the variety of different business models operated by institutions, the outcome of the supervisory benchmarks may not be appropriate in every instance for every institution. Competent authorities should address this by using the most appropriate benchmark where alternatives are available, and by applying judgement to the outcome of the benchmark to account for business-model-specific and institution-specific considerations.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:153]
PARAGRAPH_85320: 423. Competent authorities should determine P2G and P2G-LR as specified in this section, and, where the determination leads to a positive value, they should set P2G or P2G-LR to address supervisory concerns about the sensitivity of the institution to the adverse scenarios used in the supervisory stress tests.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:153]
PARAGRAPH_85321: 424. P2G is the amount of capital that should be set to reach the overall level of own funds considered appropriate under the SREP and the outcomes of supervisory stress tests. The level of P2G should protect against the potential breach of TSCR in the adverse scenario The level of P2G-LR should protect against the breach of TSLRR in the adverse scenario. Where the quantitative outcomes of the supervisory stress tests suggest that the institution is not expected to breach its TSCR under the adverse stress test scenario, competent authorities may decide not to set P2G. Similarly, competent authorities may decide not to set P2G-LR where TSLRR is not expected to be breached under the adverse stress test scenario.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:153]
PARAGRAPH_85322: 425. Competent authorities should determine and set P2G and P2G-LR based on the outcomes of the adverse scenario of the relevant supervisory stress tests, including the EU-wide stress tests performed by the EBA or any other relevant supervisory stress tests performed on a system-wide basis using a multi-factor scenario analysis over a forward-looking horizon of at least 2 years (either top-down or bottom-up).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:153]
PARAGRAPH_85323: 426. On the basis of establishing a proportionate approach for non-Category 1 institutions and subsidiaries of cross-border groups, for setting and updating P2G and P2G-LR competent authorities may consider the outcomes of simplified forms of supervisory stress tests (e.g. through the use of supervisory prescribed 'anchor' scenarios, sensitivity analysis, top-down stress tests conducted by designated authorities, portfolio level impacts from consolidated level stress tests), past supervisory stress tests or institutions' stress tests in accordance with paragraph 421. The simplified forms of supervisory stress tests may be carried out on an individual basis rather than as part of the system-wide exercise.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:153]
PARAGRAPH_85324: 427. Competent authorities should determine and set P2G and P2G-LR in accordance with the minimum engagement model specified in Section 2.2.4. In particular, the minimum frequency with which P2G and P2G-LR are determined and set should be the frequency of the capital adequacy assessment under the SREP minimum-engagement model. In particular, the simplified forms of supervisory stress tests as referred to in paragraph 426426 are not expected to have a greater frequency than the SREP, unless this is considered necessary by the competent authority.

PARAGRAPH_85328: b. may determine P2G and P2G-LR only every second year instead of annually, including for institutions for which capital adequacy, according to the SREP minimum engagement model, should be assessed annually (e.g. SREP Category 1 institutions). However, in the year that follows the year of determining P2G, competent authorities should assess, on the basis of all relevant information, including outcomes of past supervisory stress tests, together with additional sensitivity analysis (i.e. simplified forms of supervisory stress testing), whether P2G and P2G-LR are still relevant or need to be updated.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:154]
PARAGRAPH_85329: 429. Competent authorities should generally not use P2G to cover aspects of risks that should be covered by the additional own funds requirements in accordance with Section 7.2 of these guidelines. Similarly, P2G-LR should not cover those aspects of risk of excessive leverage that are covered by the additional own funds requirements in accordance with Section 7.3 of these guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:154] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_85330: 430. When determining the size of P2G, competent authorities should ensure that it is set at a level appropriate to cover at least the anticipated maximum stress impact, which should be calculated based on the changes in the CET1 ratio (i.e. considering both movements in CET1 capital and TREA) in the worst year of stress and taking into account the level of applicable capital requirements and the considerations set out in paragraphs 422422 and 432 to 436. The maximum stress impact for the purpose of setting the P2G should be understood as the difference between the lowest CET1 ratio in the adverse scenario over the stress test horizon and the actual CET1 ratio at the starting point. With regard to the determination of the size of P2G-LR, the maximum stress impact should be calculated based on the changes in the Tier 1 capital in the worst year of stress and taking into account the applicable leverage ratio capital requirements. The maximum stress impact for the purpose of setting the P2G-LR should be understood as the difference between the lowest leverage ratio in the adverse scenario over the stress test horizon and the actual leverage ratio at the starting point.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:154]
PARAGRAPH_85331: 431. Competent authorities should obtain the P2G starting point specific for each institution by offsetting elements that already cover risks reflected in the maximum stress impact. In particular, competent authorities should offset the relevant measures, in particular capital conservation buffer, as specified in paragraph 435435. In addition, when setting the P2G and P2G-LR starting points, competent authorities may consider, where relevant, other adjustments to the maximum stress impact related to the static balance sheet assumption or the different time horizon between the stress test exercise and the time of the starting point.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:154]
PARAGRAPH_85332: 432. Where setting the P2G and P2G-LR, competent authorities should ensure an adequate link between the P2G and P2G-LR starting points and, respectively, the final P2G and P2G-LR. For this purpose, they may decide to use a bucketing approach to classify institutions according to

PARAGRAPH_85334: the P2G and P2G-LR starting points, based on the relevant supervisory stress tests set out in paragraph 425 or based on other approaches set out in paragraph 426. Consequently, competent authorities may assign a fixed range of respectively P2G or P2G-LR levels to each bucket and set the final P2G and P2G-LR within the range of the assigned bucket or, exceptionally, outside the range of the relevant bucket, based on the institution-specific considerations. Competent authorities should aim to avoid cliff effects between buckets, for instance by allowing partial overlap between the P2G or P2G-LR levels for neighbouring bucket, and they should ensure that the resulting final P2G and P2G-LR are institution-specific.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:155]
PARAGRAPH_85335: 433. When determining the final P2G and P2G-LR, competent authorities should consider, where relevant, the following factors:

PARAGRAPH_85348: 434. For the purpose of determining P2G in accordance with paragraph 433.b, competent authorities should also consider the extent to which stress scenarios cover all the material risks contributing to the additional own funds requirements in TSCR. Competent authorities should in particular have regard to the fact that macroeconomic downturn scenarios may not entirely capture some risks, for example conduct risk, pension risk or some elements of credit concentration risk (e.g. single name concentration), that may amplify potential losses under the tested adverse scenarios.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:156] [RISK:SYSTEMIC_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_85349: 435. In addition, competent authorities should consider the extent to which the existing combined buffer requirements and other applicable measures already cover risks revealed by stress testing. Competent authorities should offset P2G against the capital conservation buffer (CCB), as P2G and the CCB overlap in nature. Furthermore, while no overlap is in principle expected between P2G and the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB), competent authorities should, in exceptional cases, offset P2G on a case-by-case basis against the CCyB based on the consideration of underlying risks covered by the buffer and factored into the design of the scenarios used for the stress tests, after liaising with the macroprudential authority. Competent authorities should not offset P2G against the systemic risk buffers (G-SII/O-SII buffers and the systemic risk buffer), as those are intended to cover the risks an institution poses to the financial system. Similarly, competent authorities should not offset P2G-LR against the G-SII leverage ratio buffer requirement specified in Article 92(1a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.

PARAGRAPH_85350: 436. Where competent authorities determine P2G, they should add this guidance on top of the OCR. Where competent authorities determine P2G-LR, they should add this guidance on top of OLRR. Competent authorities should consider OCR and OLRR as two separate stacks of requirements. Consequently, the available own funds can simultaneously be used to meet P2G and P2G-LR.

PARAGRAPH_85353: 438. Where P2G or P2G-LR is set or updated, competent authorities should communicate to the institution their levels and the relevant time limits for its establishment in accordance with paragraph 442442.

PARAGRAPH_85450: 460. For the assessment of liquidity needs, buffers and counterbalancing capacity under normal conditions, competent authorities should support the analysis with evidence from the reporting templates for additional monitoring metrics as specified and introduced in the ITS on supervisory reporting45. Competent authorities may perform less granular intraday liquidity risk evaluation and liquidity stress testing, where this is justified by lower materiality of these sources of risk, especially for Category 3 and Category 4 institutions.

PARAGRAPH_85470: 464. Competent authorities should assess the institution's exposure to intraday liquidity risk for a selected time horizon, including the intraday availability of liquid assets given the unpredictable nature of unexpected intraday outflows or lack of inflows. Competent authorities may take into account potentially lower materiality of this source of risk, especially for Category 3 and Category 4 institutions. For all other institutions, where this source of risk is considered material, this assessment should include, as a minimum, an evaluation of intraday liquidity available or accessible under normal conditions as well as under financial or operational stress (e.g. IT failures, legal constraints on the transfer of funds, suspension/termination of access to correspondent banking services and/or clearing services for currencies, commodities or instruments significant for the institution).

Competent authorities may assess the possible change in and sensitivity of the liquidity coverage requirement following the application of Articles 412(3) and 414 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 during mild stress scenarios, by means of supervisory or institution liquidity- specific stress testing. The scenarios applied for this assessment should typically be less severe (e.g. only market-wide stress) than the scenarios used to test the survival of the institution (market-wide and systemic stress) and consequently reflect situations in which institutions would not be expected to use their minimum liquidity buffer. When performing supervisory liquidity stress testing for Category 3 and Category 4 institutions, competent authorities may use fewer scenarios and apply lower granularity of the analysis than for other institutions.

PARAGRAPH_85614: 487. Competent authorities should assess whether an institution has implemented adequate liquidity-specific stress testing as part of its overall stress testing programme, in accordance with the EBA Guidelines on institutions' stress testing, to understand the impact of adverse events on its risk exposure and on the quantitative and qualitative adequacy of its liquid assets, and to determine whether the institution's liquidity holdings are sufficient to cover risks that may crystallise during different types of stress scenarios and/or to address risks posed by control, governance or other deficiencies. For this purpose, competent authorities should take into account whether the institution's stress testing framework is appropriate for:

PARAGRAPH_85619: 488. Competent authorities should also assess whether additional tests are needed for individual entities and/or liquidity subgroups that are exposed to significant liquidity risks. These tests should take into account the consequences of the scenarios over different time horizons, including on an intraday basis.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:176] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_85620: 489. Competent authorities should ensure that the institution provides the modelled impact of different types of stress scenarios, as well as a number of sensitivity tests (on the basis of proportionality). Careful consideration should be given to the assessment of the design of stress scenarios and the variety of shocks simulated in them, taking into account whether, in this design, the institution not only considers the past, but also makes use of hypotheses based on expert judgement. Competent authorities should analyse whether the following scenarios are considered as a minimum:

PARAGRAPH_85624: 490. An important aspect that competent authorities should consider when assessing the institution's stress testing framework is the modelling of the impact of the hypothetical stress scenario(s) on the institution's cash flows and on its counterbalancing capacity and survival horizon, and whether the modelling reflects the different impacts that economic stress may have on both an institution's assets and its in- and outflows.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:186]
PARAGRAPH_85771: 505. Competent authorities should determine through the SREP liquidity assessment whether the liquidity and stable funding held by the institution provides appropriate coverage of the risks to liquidity and funding assessed in accordance with Title 8. Competent authorities should also determine through the SREP liquidity assessment whether it is necessary to set specific liquidity requirements to cover risks to liquidity and funding to which an institution is or might be exposed.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:186] [RISK:LIQUIDITY_RISK]

PARAGRAPH_85792: 512. For the assessment of the institution's liquidity adequacy, competent authorities should also combine their assessments of liquidity risk and funding risk. in particular, they should take into account findings regarding:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:187] [RISK:LIQUIDITY_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_85793: a. risks not covered by liquidity requirements specified in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61, as regards the LCR, or in the Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as regards the NSFR, including intraday liquidity risk and liquidity risk beyond the 30-day time period as well as funding risk beyond 1 year;

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:188]
PARAGRAPH_85803: 514. Competent authorities should decide on the necessity of specific supervisory liquidity requirements for the institution based on their supervisory judgement and following dialogue with the institution, taking into account the following:

PARAGRAPH_85807: 515. . When competent authorities conclude that specific liquidity requirements are needed to address liquidity and funding concerns, they should decide on the application of quantitative requirements, as covered in this title, and/or on the application of qualitative requirements, as covered in Title 10.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:188]
PARAGRAPH_85808: 516. When setting structural, long-term supervisory requirements, competent authorities should consider the need for additional short/medium-term requirements as an interim solution to mitigate the risks that persist while the structural requirements produce the desired effects.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:188]
PARAGRAPH_85809: 517. 7. Where competent authorities conclude that there is a high risk that the institution's cost of funding will increase unacceptably, they should consider measures, including setting additional own funds requirements (as covered in Title 7) to compensate for the increased P&L impact if the institution cannot pass the increased costs of funding to its customers, or requesting changes to the funding structure, to mitigate the funding-cost risk.

PARAGRAPH_85810: 9.4 Determination of specific quantitative liquidity requirements

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:188]
PARAGRAPH_85811: 518. Competent authorities should develop and apply supervisory liquidity benchmarks as quantitative tools to support their assessment of whether the liquidity held by the institution provides sound coverage of risks to liquidity and funding. They should be used to provide a prudent, consistent, transparent and comparable benchmark with which to calculate and compare specific quantitative liquidity requirements for institutions.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:189]
PARAGRAPH_85813: 519. When developing supervisory liquidity benchmarks, competent authorities should take into account the following criteria:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:189]
PARAGRAPH_85814: a. benchmarks should be prudent, consistent and transparent;

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:189]
PARAGRAPH_85815: b. benchmarks should be developed using the supervisory assessment of risks to liquidity and funding and the supervisory liquidity stress tests; supervisory liquidity stress testing should be a core part of the benchmark;

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:189] [RISK:LIQUIDITY_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_85816: c. benchmarks should provide comparable outcomes and calculations so that quantifications of liquidity requirements for institutions with similar business models and risk profiles can be compared; and

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:189]
PARAGRAPH_85817: d. benchmarks should help supervisors to specify the appropriate level of liquidity for an institution.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:189]
PARAGRAPH_85818: 520. Given the variety of different business models operated by institutions, the outcome of the supervisory benchmarks may not be appropriate in every instance for every institution. Competent authorities should address this by using the most appropriate benchmark where alternatives are available, and/or by applying judgement to the outcome of the benchmark to account for business-model-specific considerations.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:189] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_85819: 521. Competent authorities should assess the suitability of any benchmarks applied to institutions and continually review and update them in light of the experience of using them.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:189]
PARAGRAPH_85820: 522. When competent authorities take supervisory benchmarks into consideration for the determination of specific liquidity requirements, as part of the dialogue, they should explain to the institution the rationale and general underlying principles behind the benchmarks.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:189] [RISK:LIQUIDITY_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_85821: 523. Where competent authorities have not developed their own benchmark for the quantification of specific quantitative liquidity requirements, they can apply a benchmark using the following steps particularly in the case of liquidity risk:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:189]
PARAGRAPH_85822: a. comparative analysis, under stressed conditions, of net cash outflows and eligible liquid assets over a set of time horizons: up to 1 month (including overnight), from 1 month to 3 months and from 3 months to 1 year; for this purpose, competent authorities should project net outflows (gross outflows and inflows) and counterbalancing capacity throughout different maturity buckets, considering stressed conditions (for example, prudent valuation under stress assumptions for liquid assets versus current valuation under normal conditions and after a haircut), building a stressed maturity ladder for the year ahead;

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:189]
PARAGRAPH_85823: b. based on the assessment of the stressed maturity ladder, estimation of the survival period of the institution;

PARAGRAPH_85826: d. if the desired/supervisory minimum survival period is longer than the institution's current survival period, competent authorities may estimate additional amounts of liquid assets (additional liquidity buffers) to be held by the institution to extend its survival period to the minimum required.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:190]
PARAGRAPH_85827: 524. A key input to the competent authority's benchmarks for the quantification of specific quantitative liquidity requirements will be the data collected through the supervisory reporting under Article 415 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on liquidity and on stable funding on an individual and consolidated basis and on additional liquidity monitoring metrics. The design of benchmarks will be influenced by the content of this reporting and the implementation of benchmarks will depend on when the reports are available.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:190]
PARAGRAPH_85828: 525. Below are some examples of the possible approaches:

PARAGRAPH_85829: a. Example 1: institution with an initial liquidity buffer of EUR 1 200 mln Cumulative inflows and cumulative outflows estimated under stressed conditions are projected through a time horizon of 5 months. During this time horizon, the institution makes use of the liquidity buffer each time inflows fall below outflows. The result is that, under the stressed conditions defined, the institution would be able to survive 4.5 months, which is longer than the minimum survival period set by supervisors (in this example, 3 months):

An alternative measure to setting a minimum survival period, which can also address the supervisory concern that the gap between inflows and outflows is unacceptably high, is to set a cap on outflows. In the figure below, the mechanism for setting a cap on outflows is shown by the black horizontal bar. An institution is required to reduce its outflows to a level below the cap. The cap can be set for one or more time buckets and for net outflows (following correction for inflows) or gross outflows. The alternative of adding a buffer requirement instead is shown in the third column:

PARAGRAPH_86007: 526. To articulate the specific quantitative liquidity requirements appropriately, competent authorities should use one of the following approaches, unless another approach is considered more appropriate in specific circumstances:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:192]
PARAGRAPH_86008: a. Approach 1 - require an LCR higher than the regulatory minimum, of such a size that shortcomings identified are sufficiently mitigated;

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:192]
PARAGRAPH_86009: b. Approach 2 - require a minimum survival period of such a length that identified shortcomings are sufficiently mitigated; the survival period can be set either directly, as a requirement, or indirectly, by setting a cap on the amount of outflows over the relevant time buckets considered; competent authorities may require different types of liquid assets (e.g. assets eligible for central banks), to cover risks not (adequately) covered by the LCR;

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:193]
PARAGRAPH_86011: c. Approach 3 - require a minimum total amount of liquid assets or counterbalancing capacity, either as a minimum total amount or as a minimum amount in excess of the applicable regulatory minimum, of such a size that identified shortcomings are sufficiently mitigated; competent authorities may set requirements for the composition of liquid assets, including operational requirements (e.g. direct convertibility to cash, or deposit of the liquid assets at the central bank).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:193]

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:193]
PARAGRAPH_86015: 528. To ensure there is consistency, competent authorities should structure specific quantitative liquidity requirements in such a manner as to deliver broadly consistent prudential outcomes across institutions, bearing in mind that the types of requirements specified may differ between institutions because of their individual circumstances. In addition to the quantity, the structure should specify the expected composition and nature of the requirement. In all cases, it should specify the supervisory requirement and any applicable Directive 2013/36/EU requirements. Liquidity buffers and counterbalancing capacity held by the institution to meet supervisory requirements should be available for use by the institution during times of stress.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:193] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_86016: 529. When setting the specific quantitative liquidity requirements and communicating them to the institution, competent authorities should ensure that they are immediately notified by the institution if it does not meet the requirements, or does not expect to meet the requirements in the short term. Competent authorities should ensure that this notification is submitted without undue delay by the institution, accompanied by a plan drawn up by the institution for the timely restoration of compliance with the requirements. Competent authorities should assess the feasibility of the institution's restoration plan and take appropriate supervisory measures if the plan is not considered feasible. Where the plan is considered feasible, competent authorities should: determine any necessary interim supervisory measures based on the circumstances of the institution; monitor the implementation of the restoration plan; and closely monitor the institution's liquidity position, asking the institution to increase its reporting frequency if necessary.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:211]
PARAGRAPH_86282: 580. TSCR is a legally binding requirement that institutions have to meet at all times, including in stressed conditions. If TSCR set in accordance with these guidelines is no longer met, the competent authorities should consider additional intervention powers in accordance with Directives 2013/36/EU and 2014/59/EU, including withdrawal of authorisation in accordance with Article 18(d) of Directive 2013/36/EU, application of early intervention measures in accordance with Article 27 of Directive 2014/59/EU and resolution actions in accordance with that Directive. When exercising those powers competent authorities should consider whether measures are proportionate to the circumstances and their judgement on how the situation is likely to develop.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:211] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_86283: 81.

PARAGRAPH_86287: 583. Competent authorities should monitor whether the amount of own funds expected according to P2G is established and maintained by the institution over time.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:212]
PARAGRAPH_86288: 584. When the institution's own funds drop, or are likely to drop, below the level determined by P2G, the competent authority should expect the institution to notify it and prepare a revised capital plan. In its notification, the institution should explain what adverse consequences are likely to force it to do so and what actions are envisaged for the eventual restoration of compliance with P2G as part of an enhanced supervisory dialogue.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:212]
PARAGRAPH_86289: 585. There are generally three situations to be considered by a competent authority in which an institution could fail to meet its P2G.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:212]
PARAGRAPH_86290: a. Where the level of own funds falls below the level of P2G (while remaining above OCR) in institution-specific or external circumstances in which risks that P2G was aimed at covering have materialised, the competent authority may allow the institution to temporarily operate below the level of P2G provided that the revised capital plan is considered credible in accordance with the criteria set out in Section 7.7.2. The competent authority may also consider adjusting the level of P2G where appropriate.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:212]
PARAGRAPH_86291: b. Where the level of own funds falls below the level of P2G (while remaining above the OCR) in institution-specific or external circumstances as a result of the materialisation of risks that P2G was not aimed at covering, competent authorities should expect the institution to increase the level of own funds to the level of P2G within an appropriate timeline.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:212]
PARAGRAPH_86293: Where the permission to operate below the level of P2G as referred to in point (a) has not been granted and the institution's own funds are repeatedly below the level of P2G, the competent authority should impose additional own funds requirements in accordance with Title 7.

PARAGRAPH_86294: 586. Notwithstanding particular supervisory responses in accordance with the previous paragraph, competent authorities may also consider the application of the capital and additional supervisory measures set out in Sections 10.3 and 10.5, where these are deemed more appropriate to address the reasons for the own funds falling below the level determined by P2G.

PARAGRAPH_86311: 592. This title addresses the application of the common SREP procedures and methodology as specified in these guidelines in relation to cross-border groups and their entities. It also provides links with the joint assessment and decision process to be carried out pursuant to Article 113 of Directive 2013/36/EU and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 710/2014 with regard to conditions of application of the joint decision process for institution-specific prudential requirements.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:215]
PARAGRAPH_86312: 593. In the SREP, competent authorities should also consider the potential ML/TF risks, taking into account input received from the AML/CFT competent authority of the Member State where a parent undertaking is established as well as AML/CFT supervisors responsible for the AML/CFT supervision of establishments of the group in different jurisdictions, in particular the assessments of ML/TF risks, material weaknesses and breaches of AML/CFT legislation, that are linked to the cross-border banking group structure.

PARAGRAPH_86315: 595. When applying the SREP and these guidelines to cross-border groups, competent authorities should assess the viability of the group as a whole, as well as its individual entities. This can be done by dividing the process into two stages: (1) competent authorities make an initial assessment of entities under their direct supervision, and (2) competent authorities jointly discuss and finalise the assessment within the framework of colleges of supervisors pursuant to the requirements of Articles 113 and 116 of Directive 2013/36/EU.

PARAGRAPH_86321: 597. Where these guidelines are applied to the subsidiaries of a cross-border group as specified in the paragraph above, competent authorities for subsidiaries should, when performing their initial assessment, primarily consider institutions on an individual basis, i.e. assess the business model, strategy, internal governance and institution-wide controls, risks to capital and liquidity, and capital and liquidity adequacy of an entity as they would a standalone institution. The findings from such initial assessments, where relevant, should also include identification of key vulnerabilities in the cross-border or group context, which may be related to the reliance of an institution on its parent/group for funding, capital, technological support, etc. In their initial assessments made on an individual basis, competent authorities should also reflect strengths and mitigating factors related to the entity being part of the group, which may be related to group technological support, financial support arrangements, etc.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:216]
PARAGRAPH_86322: 598. The results of any such initial assessment of the SREP elements, including, if identified, views on key dependencies on the parent/group, should serve as an input into the joint assessment and decision process pursuant to the requirements of Article 113 of Directive 2013/36/EU, and should therefore be discussed by the competent authorities within the framework of the colleges of supervisors established pursuant to Article 116 of Directive 2013/36/EU.

PARAGRAPH_86413: c. Competent authorities should consider the appropriate timelines for conducting supervisory stress tests, including the time horizon of the scenarios and the period over which the management actions proposed by institutions in the stress test exercise are analysed.

PARAGRAPH_86420: b. For the purposes of bottom-up stress tests, competent authorities should consider the extent to which they prescribe the methodologies for modelling institutions' balance sheets and P&L. Indicatively, institutions' balance sheets may be taken as static, allowing competent authorities to assess current risks over time. Alternatively, they may be allowed to be dynamic, permitting, for example, a more forward-looking exploration of how institutions' business plans might evolve under the stress scenario or how credit volumes might evolve over time. For enhanced comparability, competent authorities may consider opting for the static balance sheet approach. Conversely, for enhanced feedback on institutions' intended or planned reactions vis-a-vis stresses and shocks, the dynamic balance sheet approach may be favoured.

PARAGRAPH_86422: d. For the purposes of bottom-up supervisory stress tests, competent authorities should aim to assess the impact of such exercises consistently and fairly across the institutions covered by supervisory stress tests, respecting the level playing field. Competent authorities should also consider the extent to which stress test results reflect differences in modelling choices and judgements among institutions, rather than true differences in the risks to which they are exposed.

PARAGRAPH_86423: 633. Competent authorities should aim to assess model risk across stress testing exercises and have access to different types of comparative information. It is recommended to have, where appropriate, several perspectives/benchmarks. It is important to recognise that all models are imperfect and to clearly identify known and potential weaknesses. Understanding these limitations and weaknesses of individual institutions' stress testing models can inform the supervisory stress testing process and mitigate potential problems arising from model risk.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:230] [RISK:MARKET_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_86481: The Directive amending the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD 5) entered into force on 27 June 2019 and became applicable on 29 December 2020 with the exception of some provisions. According to the EBA risk reduction package roadmaps 57, the EBA should amend the SREP guidelines in order to be aligned to the new changes introduced in the Pillar 2 framework. The changes introduced by CRD V include: (i) the incorporation of elements related to ML/TF risks; (ii) more detailed clarifications on the conditions for setting the Pillar 2 capital add-ons and the quality of required capital; (iii) the introduction of capital add-ons for the risk of excessive leverage; (iv) the microprudential perspective of Pillar 2 capital add-ons in order to avoid overlaps with macroprudential tools; (v) the inclusion of the Pillar 2 guidance as part of the joint decision on institution-specific prudential requirements; and (vi) the mandate to consider inclusion of ESG risks. Lastly, the framework for the interest rate risk in the non-trading book (IRRBB) is modified with the introduction of the credit spread risk in the banking book (CSRBB), a common and simplified standardised approach for IRRBB and the inclusion of the net interest income (NII) perspective to the economic value of equity (EVE) for the purposes of interest rate risk management, disclosures and prudential supervision. In addition, proportionality provisions applicable to small and non- complex institutions and to large institutions were introduced in the revised Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR 2). This regulatory classification should also be reflected in the application of the proportionality principle in the SREP.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:230]
PARAGRAPH_86482: In order to incorporate the relevant CRD V / CRR 2 provisions into the already existing set of guidelines that set the basis of the day-to-day work of supervisors, a second revision of the SREP guidelines was undertaken.

The version of the guidelines that is currently applicable is the Revised EBA Guidelines on common procedures and methodology for the supervisory review and evaluation process and supervisory stress testing59, which was the result of a first review of the SREP guidelines undertaken in 2018. This first revision introduced P2G, integrated supervisory stress tests, detailed supervisory assessment of banks' stress testing, clarified certain aspects of the scoring framework, introduced a better explanation of the interaction between the SREP elements and the articulation of the total SREP capital requirements (TSCR) and overall capital requirements (OCR), among others.

PARAGRAPH_86502: This option ensures that the definition of small and non-complex institutions is reflected in the SREP categorisation and a more detailed guidance in that regard is provided, allowing better differentiation between the SREP Categories 3 and 4. With additional flexibility granted to the supervisor in allocation of institutions to categories, this option creates a possibility to better allocate supervisory resources.

PARAGRAPH_86503: This option will create more differentiation between the categories applicable to small institutions (3 and 4), reducing the burden for those small and non-complex institutions that could be reclassified from Category 3 to Category 4.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:232]
PARAGRAPH_86507: This option implements Article 104a of CRD V into the SREP guidelines, including clarification that the process for setting additional own funds requirements should be divided into two steps: (a) the determination of the capital considered adequate by the competent authority; (b) the determination of additional own funds requirements by deducting the relevant Pillar 1 requirement from the capital considered adequate. Thus, Pillar 1 requirements is the floor for the calculation of Pillar 2. Further clarifications on the application of this approach on a risk-by risk basis allow greater consistency of supervisory approaches and level playing field for EU institutions.

PARAGRAPH_86509: Under this option, the current guidance would remain largely unchanged, apart from clarification that the risks considered should be institution-specific (i.e. systemic risk would be eliminated from the scope of Pillar 2 add-ons, in line with CRD V). This option ensures flexibility to competent authorities and promotes continuation of current practices, but may also reinforce inconsistencies among supervisory practices, affecting level playing field for institutions.

PARAGRAPH_86511: Role of ICAAP in the methodology for setting P2R

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:232]
PARAGRAPH_86512: Option 1: ICAAP calculations are the starting point for P2R determination (current approach).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:233]
PARAGRAPH_86514: The current approach set in the guidelines set the ICAAP as the starting point for the P2R determination, supplemented by other relevant inputs. However, according to the CRD, ICAAP should be taken into account, which means that there is the possibility of considering other possible sources of information at the same level of importance as ICAAP for the purposes of P2R (i.e. supervisory reporting and benchmark calculations and other relevant inputs). While this approach puts particular emphasis on the use of ICAAP and encourages institutions to improve its quality for the purpose of internal risk management, it may not be appropriate to apply it in cases where the ICAAP calculations are not sufficiently reliable. Furthermore, given different methodologies used by institutions as well as different levels of conservatism, this approach may pose a challenge in ensuring overall comparability of the outcomes between institutions.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:233]
PARAGRAPH_86515: Option 2: ICAAP used for identification and assessment of risks and, if reliable, considered for the quantification of P2R

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:233]
PARAGRAPH_86516: Under this option, it is recognised that ICAAP carries a lot of valuable information, not only in the form of calculations of economic capital, but also the qualitative information related to risk management. Therefore, even in cases where ICAAP calculations are not sufficiently reliable, the qualitative information is a valuable input for identification and assessment of risks. For the purpose of the P2R quantification ICAAP calculations should be taken into account only if they are reliable, together with other sources of information, such as benchmark calculations and other relevant inputs. This option will still keep ICAAP as the most prominent source of information for SREP purposes, while ensuring compliance with CRD V and recognising the need to consider other relevant inputs.

PARAGRAPH_86519: Option 1: Bucketing approach

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:233]
PARAGRAPH_86520: This proposed methodology maintains the main policy choices of the 2018 revision in order to calculate P2G: (i) usage of the adverse scenario of stress tests; (ii) consideration of the worst year of the scenario; (iii) the offsetting of P2G against elements of the combined capital buffer with potential overlap (i.e. Capital Conservation Buffer); and (iv) P2G should meet with CET1 capital. As the novelty in the proposed methodology institutions would be classified into buckets of capital depletion under the maximum stress test impact, calculated based on the changes in the CET1 ratio and the TREA in the worst year of stress under the adverse scenario of the relevant stress test. The buckets would be defined on an absolute basis in order to be institution-specific as prescribed by Article 104b of CRD. Under this methodology, the P2G starting point would be the result of the difference between the stress test maximum depletion under the adverse scenario and elements of overlapping (i.e. 2.5% of Capital Conservation Buffer, other adjustments like the Static Balance Sheet Assumption, etc.). This option would ensure the level playing field in the EU by the harmonisation of the P2G methodology. At the same time, the possibility to apply additional adjustments in line with the guidance provided allows flexibility to address specific situations.

PARAGRAPH_86522: Option 2: Current approach

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:234]
PARAGRAPH_86523: The current approach, in which flexibility is granted to competent authorities, would be maintained. Therefore, different methodologies for the calculation of P2G would remain in place across the EU, not all of them based on the results of the adverse scenario of the stress test. This heterogeneity brings a high level of dispersion in the final outcomes of P2G and poses a risk for the level playing field across the EU.

PARAGRAPH_86528: P2G-LR is set to cover potential losses revealed by supervisory stress scenarios, and ultimately aims at allowing an institution to meet its TSLRR under stress conditions. Using CET1 capital to cover P2G-LR ensures a timely and efficient loss absorption capacity. Moreover, under such an option, the quality of capital to cover P2G-LR will mirror the quality of capital to cover P2G ensuring consistency between such requirements.

PARAGRAPH_86530: The leverage ratio overall capital requirements, including the leverage ratio G-SII buffer, shall be covered using Tier 1 capital. Under this option, the coverage of P2G-LR is aligned with such requirements, easing competent authorities' monitoring of the leverage ratio-based capital requirements. Moreover, Article 104b of the CRD does not prescribe any capital quality to cover P2G-LR, requiring only an appropriate level 'own funds' in light of their loss-absorption capabilities under stress conditions. Based on the current legal framework (notably the CRR and the EBA RTS on own funds), reinforced by the EBA work on the monitoring of capital instruments strengthening the consistency and quality of such instruments, AT1 capital is therefore considered of sufficient quality to timely and effectively absorb losses under stress conditions.

In view of the urgency to provide advice on this topic, the EBA published an Opinion on how to take into account ML/TF risks in the SREP61. The opinion provides advice at a high level on the subject in anticipation of the more detailed common guidance included in the revised SREP Guidelines.

This approach would not be fully aligned with CRD V, because from the paragraph added into Article 97 (amending Directive 2013/36/EU) it is inferred that the ML/TF risk is expected to be assessed within the other areas (in particular the evaluation of the governance arrangements, the business model or the activities of an institution). The paragraph introduced an explicit requirement for prudential supervisors to immediately notify the EBA and the AML/CFT supervisor of the institution where a review gives reasonable grounds to suspect that, in connection with that institution, money laundering or terrorist financing is being or has been committed or attempted, or there is increased risk thereof.

PARAGRAPH_86538: Therefore, this option would add clarity about how to assess ML/TF risks from a prudential perspective (as all the elements to be assessed would be part of a separate section), but there could be duplication with other areas already covered in the SREP process (business model, internal governance and controls, etc.) as the ML/TF weaknesses are closely related to those areas. This could lead to overlaps in the overall assessment.

PARAGRAPH_86548: Regarding the process of assigning scores to assess the level of ML/TF risk, two options were considered, that ML/TF risks and concerns should either form part of a separate risk score or they should be considered within the scores of the risk to which ML/TF risk is related.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:236]
PARAGRAPH_86549: Option 1: Separate scoring for ML/TF risk

PARAGRAPH_86550: Under this option, ML/TF risk would be scored separately from the other risks. In order to build the scores, the supervisory considerations on the risk would be closely related to the other areas involved in which ML/TF has been identified (i.e. internal governance, operational risk, etc.). Moreover, this policy decision is closely related to the integrated approach assessed above. Thus, as it was decided to opt for an integrated approach in order to assess ML/TF risks under the SREP (instead of creating a separated section or the SREP component for ML/TF risk), the scoring should not be misaligned with this choice and thus the scores are related to the current existing titles of the guidelines.

For example, as ML/TF concerns related to the credit granting process and origin of funds to repay are considered within Title 6 of assessing risks to capital, the assessment of prudential supervisor on this specific topic should feed the score of risks to capital. This option is more aligned with the integrated approach selected in order to review the SREP guidelines and would avoid creating overlaps with the other risk scores. The option not to create a separate ML/TF risk score also reflects the delineation of the respective roles of competent authorities and AML/CFT supervisors.

PARAGRAPH_86557: Under this option, the incorporation of ML/TF risks into the SREP would be based solely on information related and obtained from prudential reporting. This option would be sufficient for Title 3 (monitoring of key indicators), in order to build quantitative indicators based on prudential reporting. However, for the rest of the areas (business models, internal governance and controls), the input from AML/CFT supervisors related to findings from their assessments and material weaknesses in AML/CFT controls, would be key to ensuring that the prudential supervisor is considering all the information available that could be useful to relate these material weaknesses to risks that could lead to prudential shortcomings.

The submitted data is composed by 192 banks that are under the direct supervision of 27 national competent authorities and represent 58% of European banking sector' assets. The sample is heterogeneous, composed by 81 systemic banks, 40 medium sized banks and 79 institutions with consolidated assets below EUR 5 bn (of which 8 of them are considered systemic). In terms of the SREP categorisation, the sample is also heterogeneous, composed of 92 banks classified in the SREP Category 1, 33 banks classified in the SREP Category 2, 41 banks classified in the SREP Category 3 and 18 banks classified in the SREP Category 4.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:238] [RISK:CONCENTRATION_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_86590: Under the CRD V, P2R will not only cover risks excluded or not explicitly addressed in Pillar 1, but also risks underestimated in Pillar 1. Pillar 1 acts as a floor for the own funds requirements for a given risk. In the survey, most jurisdictions (24 out of 27 respondents) stated that their methodology to obtain P2R considers risks underestimated in Pillar 1. The rest (3 out of 26) use P2R to cover risks not adequately captured in Pillar 1: one uses P2R to cover only IRRBB, other covers IRRBB and concentration risk and other covers maturity risk, risk weight floor for corporate exposures and risk weight floor for exposures covered by commercial real estate. Among the 24 jurisdictions that cover Pillar 1 risks with P2R, 23 of them also use P2R to cover risks excluded or not explicitly addressed in the Pillar 1 framework. Therefore, most jurisdictions (23 out of 27) are aligned with the methodology for setting P2R of considering Pillar 1 risks and additional risks not addressed in Pillar 1 and they set the Pillar 1 floor on a risk-by-risk basis. Thus, the cost of implementing this methodology in the EU banking sector is moderate.

PARAGRAPH_86686: P2G is included in Article 104b of CRD V and competent authorities should develop their methodology to apply P2G to the institutions under their direct supervision. Out of the 27 respondents, 7 competent authorities do not apply P2G yet to the institutions supervised by them, 3 competent authorities do not apply P2G based on stress test results and 7 competent authorities apply either caps or floors in the P2G calculation (i.e. not purely an institution-specific calculation as prescribed in CRD V). Thus, more than half of the competent authorities (17 out of 27) would need modifications in their P2G methodology. The impact of this is expected to be medium.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:241]
PARAGRAPH_86687: The methodologies used are divergent. For example, one competent authority uses a bucketing methodology according to the CET 1 depletion in the adverse scenario, other calculates P2G as a difference between capital depletion plus a hurdle rate and the sum of Pillar 1, Pillar 2 and capital conservation buffer and another uses ICAAP parameters on a risk-by-risk basis. This divergence is translated in a high deviation in P2G across countries, as can be observed in Chart 4, which has been obtained for each country that account with at least two banks with positive P2G value.

PARAGRAPH_86717: Among the competent authorities that calculate P2G based on stress test result without applying caps or floor in the calculation, the final P2G applied shows a high correlation with the depletion of the adverse scenario of the stress test. However, this only occurs for less than half of the banks of the sample (86 banks from 17 countries), which represents a significant proportion of the banks of the sample with positive P2G value (103 banks from 20 countries). Therefore, the majority of competent authorities that apply positive values of P2G are using methodologies based on ST results. However, a few jurisdictions that currently do not apply P2G based on stress test results or do not have any methodology to set P2G would need to align their methodologies to incorporate P2G and to amend their P2G methodology in order to consider the adverse scenario of the stress test without caps and floors.

PARAGRAPH_86754: The comments received by the EBA touched upon a broad range of areas addressed in the guidelines and more specifically: categorisation of the credit institutions, business model analysis, assessment of the internal governance and institution-wide controls, assessment of risks to capital, assessment of risks to liquidity and funding risk, assessment of the risk of excessive leverage, calculation of additional own funds requirements and the P2G, as well as application of supervisory measures. Other comments were specifically targeting the proposed provisions related to the incorporation of ML/TF risks in the SREP.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:244]
PARAGRAPH_86755: The respondents raised a number of comments of a more general nature. These included in particular the opportunity to introduce further proportionality and simplification in the text of the guidelines, arguing that more clarity is needed with regard to the practical application of the general principle of proportionality reflected in the guidelines. Furthermore, many respondents raised the issue of the role of the ICAAP in the assessment of capital adequacy and the setting of P2R and P2G, advocating stronger incorporation of the ICAAP information and estimates into the overall framework for setting additional own funds requirements. One of the most commented areas was the assessment of the risk of excessive leverage and the related additional own funds requirements and guidance (P2R-LR and P2G-LR). Given the novelty of these requirements, several respondents expressed concerns about the application of the proposed guidance and appropriate calibration of the P2R-LR and P2G-LR.

PARAGRAPH_86758: The BSG encouraged the EBA to further reflect the principle of proportionality throughout the text of the guidelines, it pointed out the need to take into account the SPE/MPE organisational structure in the context of the assessment of the internal governance and stressed the importance of addressing ICT as a separate source of risk. The objective of enhanced transparency was welcomed by the BSG, and also in the context of the communication and justification of additional own funds requirements to institutions. Finally, the BSG indicated it shared the view of the EBA that there should be complementarity between supervisory authorities and encouraged the EBA to keep working on the proposed line to ensure fluent coordination without creating an overwhelming flow of demands to institutions.

PARAGRAPH_86770: MPE/SPE organisational models

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:246]
PARAGRAPH_86771: Some respondents suggested that the text of the GL should explicitly recognise the difference between MPE (multiple point of entry) and SPE (single point of entry) organisational models. More specifically, the respondents claimed that supervisors should appropriately consider in their assessment that MPE models imply a decentralised management of capital and liquidity (thus their organisational structure envisages the presence of different subsidiaries) whereas SPE models entail centralised management. In the opinion of the respondents, the areas covered by the supervisory assessment where these different organisational models have an impact are those related to liquidity and business model. In the case of liquidity, for instance, the respondents argued that directly comparing banks having an MPE with those having an SPE model might be inaccurate and thus lead to incorrect conclusions. Similarly, for business model analysis it was claimed

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:246]
PARAGRAPH_86772: In accordance with the requirements laid out in Directive 2013/36/EU, the SREP is carried out in principle at the solo and the consolidated level. When performing the assessment at the consolidated level, competent authorities should take into account the structure of the group and the relations between specific entities of the group. Already in the preliminary assessment of the business model competent authorities should take into account, among others, any major geographies, subsidiaries, branches and business lines. These aspects are then further explored in the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the business model. The terminology of SPE/MPE is used in the context of resolution strategies. However, different resolution tools or combinations thereof may be applied in cases of bank failures (e.g. sale of business, asset separation and bail-in). Therefore, this is addressed in the SREP GL in a more general manner, by the requirement that in conducting the business model analysis competent

PARAGRAPH_86780: authorities should take into account the recovery and resolution plans. The level of application of the SREP is clarified in Section 1.3 of the guidelines. In the specific context of liquidity, it is already recognised that 'when an institution has established a liquidity sub-group pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, competent authorities should conduct their assessment of risks to liquidity and funding, and apply supervisory measures, for the entities covered by such subgroup at the level of the liquidity sub-group'. Therefore, no further changes are considered necessary in the Guidelines to specifically reflect MPE/SPE organisational models. However, some additional clarifications are introduced in the context of the use of recovery and resolution plans as a source of information for the SREP, and the cooperation with resolution authorities.

PARAGRAPH_86792: Holistic approach to inclusion of ML/TF risks in the SREP

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:248]
PARAGRAPH_86793: Several respondents indicated competent authorities should take a holistic approach to avoid the inclusion of ML/TF risks as a separate risk category into the different SREP components automatically resulting in downgrading the SREP score. According to the respondents, such an integrated approach should also ensure any supervisory measures imposed under the SREP should follow this integrated approach and not look at ML/TF risk in isolation to other risks. A few respondents suggested to use a hybrid solution using an integrated approach to incorporate ML/TF risks in the existing SREP elements, but with an individualised assessment and scoring for ML/TF risks.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:248]
PARAGRAPH_86794: The EBA has taken an integrated approach to incorporating ML/TF risks into the SREP, rather than creating a separate risk category with a separate risk score. In that respect, there will only be an impact on the SREP scores in as far as there is a prudential impact of the ML/TF risks on the related risks. With regard to the proposed hybrid solution, the EBA notes the point and wishes to clarify that the integrated approach has been taken in order to avoid overlaps with the AML/CFT supervisory function that is responsible for the supervision, assessment and scoring of ML/TF risks.

PARAGRAPH_86798: ML/TF risks are not assessed and scored as a separate risk under the SREP. In line with the integrated approach, the prudential impact of ML/TF risks feeds into the assessment and scoring of the related risks. Under the assessment and scoring approach in the SREP as explained in Section 2.2.1, scores should represent the residual risk.

PARAGRAPH_86808: Whereas it was pointed out that the inclusion of ML/TF risks will enhance the SREP supervisory framework by adding more clarity and greater harmonisation, several respondents voiced concern that there could be a possible risk of overlap between the prudential and AML/CFT supervisory functions. Such an overlap would lead to a possible duplication of reporting, and assessment of ML/TF risks and potential double penalties for the same breach in the context of both the supervision under Directive (EU) 2015/849 (AMLD) and under the SREP. In this context, one respondent indicated it should be avoided that the various phases of the SREP process would be hampered due to a lack of effective coordination and timely information exchange between supervisory authorities. Linked to this, some respondents also pointed out that only the AML/CFT supervisors have the expertise to assess the ML/TF risks, and that the competent authorities should rely on the expertise of the AML/CFT supervisors to assess the ML/TF risks.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:249]
PARAGRAPH_86809: The guidelines should not lead to duplication of reporting as no additional reporting requirements are established for institutions through these guidelines. As regards the assessment of the ML/TF risks, as clarified in the background and rationale section, and in line with the integrated approach, the ML/TF risks only feed into the SREP assessment in as far as there is a prudential impact on the related risks, whereas the ML/TF risks under Directive (EU) 2015/849 (AMLD) are assessed by the AML/CFT supervisor. Also, in line with the EBA AML/CFT Cooperation Guidelines under CRD Article 117(6) (EBA/GL/2021/15), competent authorities and AML/CFT supervisors should ensure a timely exchange of the relevant outcomes of their respective assessments and information regarding the supervisory measures and sanctions within their supervisory remit. The structured cooperation and mutual information under these guidelines should allow prudential and AML/CFT supervisors to inform their respective supervisory activities and avoid unnecessary duplications or interference of supervisory measures. Whereas a reference to the AML/CFT Cooperation Guidelines was already included in a number of places, references to these guidelines have now been added in paragraphs 74, 87(e), 101, 146, 475(e) and 536.

Whereas this was already included in paragraphs 56 and 58, it has been further clarified in a specific additional Subsection 2.4.6. The introduction of specific indicators and thresholds was not considered appropriate to avoid overly mechanistic application of the SREP. Competent authorities should be able to make their own assessment of the materiality of risks, given specific circumstances of the institution. However, some limited indicators were introduced, for instance through a reference to small banking book criteria in the context of the assessment of market risk. Given the above clarifications added across the guidelines, the text of paragraph 53 stating that the scope and depth of the review of the individual SREP elements should be tailored to the specific risk profile of the institution can be kept unchanged at this stage, though it has been made more apparent.

The respondent suggested that for instance a longer period could be envisaged compared to the 3 years currently foreseen for the exercise of the SREP assessment for Category 4 institutions, which is a point that was also brought up by other respondents. A few respondents suggested to clarify that the 3- yearly assessment of the SREP should cover the main elements of the SREP and not all individual criteria mentioned in the Guidelines

This has been made more apparent in paragraph 53. The notion of 'SREP element' as used throughout the guidelines is defined in Title 1 (i.e. 'SREP element' means one of the following: business model analysis, assessment of internal governance and institution- wide risk controls, assessment of risks to capital, the SREP capital assessment, assessment of risks to liquidity and funding, or the SREP liquidity assessment).

PARAGRAPH_87043: A few respondents questioned whether it is appropriate to use the CRR classifications of 'large' and 'small and non-complex' institutions for Pillar 2 purposes as they were primarily defined for the purposes of granting reporting and disclosure relief. The respondents proposed to leave competent authorities with the possibility to apply other relevant criteria, such as the business model and other criteria referred to in the EBA's discussion paper on proportionality assessment methodology (EBA/DP/2021/03). In this context, one of the respondents suggested in particular to allow competent authorities to apply other relevant criteria and classify an institution as SREP Category 4 even if the CRR criteria for 'small and non-complex institution' are not met.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:260]
PARAGRAPH_87044: Whereas the CRR classification has been linked to the Pillar 2 categorisation in order to ensure consistency in the treatment of institutions across the different Pillars, the provisions do include other relevant criteria for the categorisation. Also for SREP Category 4 other criteria are included in Section 2.1.1. In this respect, Category 4 will include institutions defined as 'small and non-complex' under the CRR, as well as all other small non-complex institutions that do not fall into categories 1 to 3 (e.g. with a limited scope of activities and non-significant market shares in their lines of business).

Competent authorities should ensure that all key function holders within an institution are suitable.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:261]
PARAGRAPH_87060: Several respondents pointed out that assessing the implementation of a diversity policy for the composition of the management body and within the institutions' recruitment policy would go beyond the provisions of the EBA Guidelines on suitability of the management body (EBA/GL/2021/06) and would contradict European and national anti-discrimination regulations. Some respondents evidenced that some institutions (especially public law institutions) have no influence on the composition of the supervisory body resulting notably from election outcomes, or appointments, and therefore cannot ensure a wide range of experience, knowledge, skills and values.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:261]
PARAGRAPH_87061: Article 91(10) of Directive 2013/36/EU specifically refers to diversity to be taken into account for the selection of members of the management body. The EBA is mandated by Article 91(12) of that Directive to issue guidelines detailing such a notion of diversity. The EBA Guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body (EBA/GL/2021/06) require diversity within the management body, both in its executive and supervisory functions, as it leads to a broader range of experience, knowledge, skills and value, therefore enhancing the functioning of such a body. Additionally, those Guidelines require diversity criteria to be reflected in the recruitment policy to ensure a sufficiently diverse pool of members of the management body. The SREP Guidelines have been clarified on that basis.

Diversity criteria should accompany anti-discrimination rules, as part of robust governance arrangements. This principle is without prejudice to national laws regarding anti- discrimination. The SREP Guidelines have been clarified on that basis. The EBA is aware of some specific legal structures and their resulting challenges. However, the provisions of Directive 2013/36/EU apply to all institutions, therefore requiring the ad hoc nomination committee to consider requirements on the composition and suitability of the management body.

The institutions' stress tests, regardless of whether they are carried out as part of the ICAAP or ILAAP, should be part of the risk management framework and therefore should be taken into account in the setup of the risk appetite.

PARAGRAPH_87136: Some respondents suggested reintroducing paragraphs 145 and 146, which were deleted in the CP. More specifically, the respondents questioned the proposed allocation of certain subcategories of risk arguing that these risks may be treated differently by different institutions and hence allocated differently in their ICAAPs. Along the same lines, some respondents argued against the introduction of CSRBB as a separate source of risk as they claimed this would not be consistent with predominant industry practices.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:266]
PARAGRAPH_87137: The specified categories and subcategories of risk are to be considered for the purpose of the supervisory assessment. However, this is not necessarily expected to be reflected by the institutions in their ICAAP. Internal risk management processes should continue to be organised by the institutions as they see it most fit in line with their specific business model and risk profile, and the ICAAP is supposed to offer an internal view of the institution on the identified risks. Therefore, differences may exist between the institution's internal and supervisory classification of risks. The specification of the most common elements of each of the main risks in the GL is important to ensure the completeness of the analysis and the level playing field for institutions that will be subject to the SREP by different authorities. For the purpose of the SREP and resulting determination of additional own funds requirements, it is important that the classification of elements of risk corresponds to their allocation in the prudential framework for Pillar 1 requirements.

PARAGRAPH_87148: - Equity Risk in the Banking Book: this is not understood as a conventional source of credit risk but rather as a market risk. - Real Estate Risk: this is understood as referring to the investment (price) risk that arises when investing in the institution's own real estate. These investments can be seen as an opportunity to broaden and diversify an institution's earnings. In this respect, it is not primarily or necessarily a credit risk, but could either be classified as a risk category on its own or addressed as a subcategory of market risk. - Model Risk: in the context of credit risk, this can only refer to IRBA and CCR models under Pillar 1 that have been approved by the supervisory authorities. These are already under the ongoing model review process and any model deficiencies can be addressed using add-ons under Pillar 1. It could also be assumed that these risks are already taken into account sufficiently in Pillar 2 by addressing model risks under operational risk. One respondent suggested correcting the reference included in footnote 45 as it was referring to the EBA Guidelines on management of non-performing and forborne exposures (EBA/GL/2018/06), whereas the text of paragraph 196(b)(ii) was referring to the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring.

Furthermore, it should be underlined that the subcategories of risk are not meant to be mutually exclusive and any measures of these subcategories of risk are not necessarily additive. Rather, these are aspects that competent authorities should take into consideration in their assessment, first by determining whether they are relevant for a given institution, then by carrying out a deeper analysis where this is necessary due to the risk profile of the institution.

Nevertheless, cases of objective operational impediments to moving the business from non-EU to EU CCPs in a timely manner may be taken into account by the competent authorities based on their normal supervisory powers.

PARAGRAPH_87169: Some respondents requested to review the guidance for the preliminary assessment of operational risk, as the information requested might not be available for smaller institutions. Some other respondents requested to further stress the importance of the ICT subcategory of risk as cybersecurity incidents represent a material source of risk for individual credit institutions and the financial stability as a whole. Another respondent suggested reverting to the previous wording of paragraph 279(a) of the CP, i.e. reference to operational risk tolerance instead of operational risk appetite (as used under the revised version of the Guidelines), as this would be more appropriate in the context of the preliminary assessment of operational risk.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:269] [RISK:OPERATIONAL_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_87170: The preliminary assessment aims at determining the areas of focus in the assessment of operational risk. These preliminary checks require competent authorities to acquire generic information on the institution's activities to flag potential areas of material operational risk. If certain areas are not materially risky to an institution, an in-depth assessment will not be necessary. The general preliminary assessment is therefore also relevant for smaller institutions. Nevertheless, the guidance was amended to further strengthen the principle of proportionality. Regarding ICT risk, it is clear that cybersecurity is an important element of risk and this is already recognised in the context of the SREP. The assessment of ICT risk under the SREP is set out in separate EBA GL on ICT Risk Assessment under the SREP (EBA/GL/2017/05). The SREP GL refer to them to avoid any repetitions or inconsistencies. The EBA GL on ICT Risk Assessment under the SREP recognise ICT security risk as a separate risk category and set out specific assessment of controls for managing this risk. The references to risk appetite have been included consistently across the guidelines in line with its definition. In addition, the latest revision of EBA Guidelines on Internal Governance includes a reference only to the risk appetite (and not risk tolerance). Therefore, to ensure consistency the EBA does not see the need to change the wording.

PARAGRAPH_87178: Some respondents requested the EBA to exclude from the text of the GL the reference to step-in risk, arguing that as described in BCBS 423, this is already covered by the risk categories included in the text (reputational risk, strategic and business risk). One respondent suggested the removal of the provisions laid out in paragraph 304(f) in Section 6.4.3 that requires competent authorities to take into account the reputation of the individuals involved in the management of the institution when performing the assessment on reputational risk to which the institution is exposed.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:270] [RISK:REPUTATIONAL_RISK] [RISK:BUSINESS_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_87179: The definition of step-in risk given in recital 9 of the RTS on Prudential consolidation (EBA/RTS/2021/04), i.e. the possibility that an institution may decide to provide financial support to an unconsolidated entity that is facing stress, even in the absence of, or in excess of, any contractual obligations, is not overlapping with the other subcategories of risk mentioned by the respondents (i.e. reputational risk, strategic and business risk). In line with the general principles applicable to the SREP, competent authorities should carry out a comprehensive assessment of risks faced by the institution, while avoiding any double counting. The assessment of reputational risk to be performed by competent authorities has the purpose of identifying the risk to which the institution is exposed and the members of the management body clearly have an influence on this risk. Nevertheless, having done the assessment, the competent authorities have to decide whether and what type of measures (qualitative or quantitative) are most adequate to address this source of risk, and also take into account actions already taken.

In view of significant investments leading to increased reliability of the ICAAP over the past year, respondents suggested the ICAAP to be the sole quantitative basis for the P2R, avoiding distorting effects linked to qualitative assessment and supervisory judgement, as well as supervisory benchmarks which tend to be overly conservative. Some respondents suggested to reinstate paragraph 360 and 361 deleted in the CP, ensuring P2R to be determined in a consistent manner with regard to the content of the ICAAP and in light of the results of supervisory dialogue and interactions with the institutions.

Nevertheless, as an internal process of an institution, the ICAAP cannot be used as the sole basis for the determination of P2R, as it may incentivise institutions to underestimate the risk. While determining P2R, competent authorities should also consider the overall consistency of requirements between institutions and should ensure a level playing field, and should therefore use other sources of information, including regulatory benchmarks. The aspects covered in deleted paragraphs 360 and 361 have been reflected in a broader sense in paragraphs 362 and 369(e) of the CP (paragraphs 363 and 370(e) of the final GL). Furthermore, the consideration of the outcomes of supervisory dialogue has been further strengthened in Section 7.6 of the Guidelines, setting out requirements for the justification of supervisory decisions.

Such an application of a Pillar 1 floor could result in overestimated Pillar 1 requirements, especially for institutions using standardised approaches.

PARAGRAPH_87242: Determining P2R-LR

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:274]
PARAGRAPH_87243: Respondents suggested to limit the imposition of P2R-LR to exceptional and duly justified cases, as the majority of institutions in the EU are not subject to risk of excessive leverage due to the nature of their business and operating models. Moreover, respondents advocated for a more specific guidance for the determination of P2R-LR, to ensure a fair and equal treatment of all institutions. Such guidance should refer to the ICAAP as the basis for the quantification of P2R-LR.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:274]
PARAGRAPH_87244: The determination of any P2R-LR is linked to the results of the competent authorities' assessment of the risk of excessive leverage, and to the consideration whether this risk is material for the institutions. However, P2R-LR should not be imposed automatically; such a decision should take into account various sources of information and supervisory judgement. The determination of P2R-LR should consider specific aspects including, if deemed reliable or at least partially reliable, the ICAAP calculations and other relevant inputs. This has been further clarified in this paragraph referring to all relevant sources of information.

Respondents agreed with paragraph 393(c), confirming that volatility in the leverage ratio could be a reason to consider P2R-LR. Respondents suggested to reword paragraphs 393(a)(i) and 393(a)(ii) in order to clarify that the nature and structure of institutions' transactions

Moreover, respondents stated that window-dressing activities should already be covered by the newly introduced regulatory reporting on SFTs. Respondents suggested to reword paragraph 393(a)(iii) on the basis that concentrations in written options on equity and short positions via credit derivatives would already be adequately covered by the standard SA-CCR treatment under Pillar 1 calculations. Some respondents suggested to reconsider the wording of paragraph 393(b), focusing only on the risk of compliance, as considering excluded items from the leverage ratio, in line with Article 429a of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, in the determination of P2R-LR would override these provisions. Other respondents presented an opposite view that compliance risk should be addressed by supervisory measures other than P2R-LR. Respondents suggested to amend paragraph 393(d) as P2R-LR should be determined based on the level of exposures and Tier 1 capital at the date of assessment, therefore excluding any foreseeable growth of such exposures.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:276]
PARAGRAPH_87273: material. This has been further clarified in the Guidelines. While it was not intended to imply that any use of certain instruments is likely to be related to regulatory arbitrage of optimisation, there are certain indicators for increased likelihood of such practices, which should be analysed by competent authorities in the context of the specific business model of the institution. The introduction of regulatory reporting on SFTs provides an overview of intra-quartile variability in exposures and is therefore a key source of information for competent authorities to identify possible window dressing/optimisation. While it may not always be related to window-dressing, also customer demand driven intra-quartile patterns in leverage ratio exposure could equally lead to vulnerabilities to be addressed by P2R-LR. On the example included in paragraph 393(a)(iii), where institutions are highly exposed to written options on equity, or to short positions via credit derivatives, the risk of higher losses can occur. Such a risk may not be sufficiently captured in the SA-CCR methodology, therefore potentially underestimating the leverage ratio exposure. The assessment of risks explicitly excluded from Pillar 1 requirements is required by Article 104a(2) of the Directive (EU) 2013/36/EU to ensure appropriate coverage of the risk of excessive leverage. In this context, while identified cases of non-compliance should be fixed without undue delay and may be subject to other supervisory measures, any concerns

The determination of P2R-LR should be made on current and not projected exposures. Therefore, the concept of 'foreseeable growth of exposures' is replaced by the narrower concept of risk of excessive leverage originating from the off-balance sheet exposures. As significant concentrations in potentially volatile off-balance sheet items can imply contingent leverage not sufficiently covered by Pillar 1 requirements, a reference to off-balance sheet exposures has been introduced in paragraph 394(a)(iii).

PARAGRAPH_87283: Respondents did not support the inclusion of proposed additional dimensions and indicators for the assessment of the risk of excessive leverage in the Guidelines. Respondents raised concerns that the dimensions and indicators go beyond the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and that their inclusion would lead to some automatism imposing P2R-LR. Moreover, since such dimensions and indicators were already considered by the EBA while calibrating the leverage ratio requirements at 3%, respondents considered that their

PARAGRAPH_87284: The dimensions were developed on the basis of the definition of the risk of excessive leverage, as defined in Article 4(1)(94) Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. The consideration of such dimensions could enrich the assessment of the different aspects of the risk of excessive leverage, without any automatism for the determination of P2R-LR. In this regard there should be no significant issue with potential double counting.

On that basis, considering them in the assessment of the risk of excessive leverage of an individual institution could enrich the analysis. However, considering the consultation feedback these dimensions were not introduced explicitly in the analysis of the risk of excessive leverage. Nevertheless, to ensure that specific circumstances are taken into account, at least the business model of the institution should be considered to identify potential high risks of excessive leverage.

Article 100 of Directive 2013/36/EU requires competent authorities to carry out as appropriate, but at least annually, supervisory stress tests on institutions they supervise whose results should be taken into account in the SREP. Paragraph 427 of the Guidelines takes into account the principle of proportionality providing some flexibility regarding the conduct of such a stress test, allowing the application of simplified forms of supervisory stress tests for non-Category 1 institutions.

PARAGRAPH_87367: Respondents argued that overlaps between P2G and other applicable measures should be avoided. On that basis, respondents considered that P2G and P2G-LR should be fully offset against all combined buffer requirements, respectively, and with the leverage ratio buffer for GSIB, as such capital requirements have the objective of covering stress effects. This was further justified considering the objective of P2G and P2G-LR of protecting against a potential breach of TSCR and TSLRR, respectively, which do not include any buffer requirements.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:282] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_87368: The potential overlaps between the buffers and P2G must be considered taking into account specific purposes of given elements of the combined buffer and the purpose of P2G. The offsetting against the capital conservation buffer and under specific circumstances against the countercyclical buffer is allowed. Other buffers are not expected to overlap with P2G due to their different specific purpose, and hence off-setting would not be appropriate.

PARAGRAPH_87450: The provisions included in the SREP GL are consistent with Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61, where the usage of the liquidity buffer is envisaged under stress even if it leads to an LCR level of below 100%. In this respect it is important to note the following requirements applicable to credit institutions: Article 412(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 requires that: 'Institutions shall hold liquid assets, the sum of the values of which covers the liquidity outflows less the liquidity inflows under stressed conditions so as to ensure that institutions maintain levels of liquidity buffers which are adequate to face any possible imbalance between liquidity inflows and outflows under gravely stressed conditions over a period of 30 days. During times of stress, institutions may use their liquid assets to cover their net liquidity outflows'. Recital 3 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 further clarifies that: 'Consistent with BCBS liquidity standards, rules should be adopted to define the liquidity coverage requirement as a ratio of a credit institution's buffer of "liquid assets" to its "net liquidity outflows" over a 30-calendar-day stress period. "Net liquidity outflows" should be calculated by deducting the credit institution's liquidity inflows from its liquidity outflows.

PARAGRAPH_87457: a minimum level of 100%, when fully implemented, which indicates that a credit institution holds sufficient liquid assets to meet its net liquidity outflows during a 30-day stress period. During such a period, a credit institution should be able to quickly convert its liquid assets into cash without recourse to central bank liquidity or public funds, which may result in its liquidity coverage ratio falling temporarily below the 100% level. Should that occur or be expected to occur at any time, credit institutions should comply with the specific requirements laid down in Article 414 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 for a timely restoration of their liquidity coverage ratio to the minimum level'. Article 4(3) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 allows that: 'By derogation from paragraph 2, credit institutions may monetise their liquid assets to cover their net liquidity outflows during stress periods, even if such a use of liquid assets may result in their liquidity coverage ratio falling below 100 % during such periods'. As highlighted in the abovementioned articles the level 1 regulation assumes the use of the liquidity buffers under stressed conditions, thus the provisions included under paragraph 494(d) (paragraph 497(d) of the final guidelines) do not contradict it.
