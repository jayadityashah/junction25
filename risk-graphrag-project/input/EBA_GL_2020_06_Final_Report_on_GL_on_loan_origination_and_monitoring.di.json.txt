PARAGRAPH_75889: Executive Summary

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_75890: The European Banking Authority (EBA) developed the Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring in response to the Council of the European Union's Action Plan on tackling the high level of non-performing exposures. The European Council, in its July 2017 Action Plan, invited the EBA to 'issue detailed guidelines on banks' loan origination, monitoring and internal governance which could in particular address issues such as transparency and borrower affordability assessment'.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_75891: The objective of the guidelines is to improve institutions' practices and associated governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms in relation to credit granting, in order to ensure that institutions have robust and prudent standards for credit risk taking, management and monitoring, and that newly originated loans are of high credit quality. The guidelines also aim to ensure that the institutions' practices are aligned with consumer protection rules and respect fair treatment of consumers. Through these objectives, the EBA aims to improve the financial stability and resilience of the EU banking system.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_75892: The guidelines specify the internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms, as laid down in Article 74(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU (Capital Requirements Directive, CRD) and further specified in the EBA Guidelines on internal governance, and requirements on credit and counterparty risk, as laid down in Article 79 of Directive 2013/36/EU in relation to the granting and monitoring of credit facilities throughout their life cycle.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_75893: The guidelines introduce requirements for assessing the borrowers' creditworthiness, together with the handling of information and data for the purposes of such assessments. These guidelines also further specify how to assess the creditworthiness of consumers and use consumer information laid down in Articles 18 and 20 of Directive 2014/17/EU (Mortgage Credit Directive, MCD). Furthermore, the guidelines also recognise the extension of the EBA's scope of action in the review of the European Supervisory Authorities' (ESAs') Founding Regulations and incorporate guidance for the creditworthiness assessment in relation to consumer credit, in accordance with Article 8 of Directive 2008/48/EC on consumer credits (Consumer Credit Directive, CCD).

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_75894: To support the dual focus of the guidelines, bringing together the prudential framework and consumer protection aspects of credit granting, the guidelines, in particular:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_75895: a. clarify the internal governance and control framework for the credit-granting and credit decision-making process, building on the requirements of the EBA Guidelines on internal governance (Section 4);

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_75896: b. specify requirements for the creditworthiness assessment of borrowers, differentiating between lending to (1) consumers, (2) micro and small enterprises and (3) medium-sized and large enterprises, and set out the requirements for handling information and data for such assessments (Section 5);

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_75903: The EBA has developed these guidelines building on existing national practices and supervisory experience, and also addressing shortcomings in institutions' credit-granting policies and practices, highlighted by the recent financial crisis. At the same time, the guidelines also reflect supervisory priorities and recent policy developments related to credit granting. In particular, the guidelines account for the growing importance of environmental, social and governance factors, and environmentally sustainable lending, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, as well as the growing use of automated and statistical models and technology-based innovation in the credit granting and collateral valuation.

PARAGRAPH_75910: 1. As part of the EU's response to tackling the high level of non-performing exposures, the Council of the European Union in its July 2017 Action Plan1 invited the EBA to 'issue detailed guidelines on banks' loan origination, monitoring and internal governance which could in particular address issues such as transparency and borrower affordability assessment'. The Council stressed that 'these guidelines should leverage on existing national experiences where relevant'.

PARAGRAPH_75911: 2. Within the framework of the Council's Action Plan, the EBA has already published Guidelines on management of non-performing and forborne exposures2, Guidelines on disclosures of non- performing and forborne exposures3 and developed non-performing loan (NPL) transaction templates 4, with a view to improving data quality and information symmetry between institutions and investors in the NPL secondary markets in Europe. These previous initiatives aim to tackle problems around loans once they become non-performing, while the Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring have been developed in order to ensure that institutions have prudential loan origination standards in place, in order to prevent newly originated performing loans from becoming non-performing in the future.

The guidelines also set out requirements for the creditworthiness assessment of borrowers, together with the collection of information and data for the purposes of such creditworthiness assessments. These guidelines also further specify the creditworthiness assessment of consumers laid down in Articles 18 and 20 of Directive 2014/17/EU (MCD) 7 and Article 8 of Directive 2008/48/EC on consumer credits (CCD)8.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_75940: 6. The main body of the guidelines comprises five sections:

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_75941: a. Section 4 provides the details for the application of the general internal governance framework, as set out in the EBA Guidelines on internal governance in relation to the credit- granting process. This section looks into the following topics: (1) credit risk governance and culture, also explaining the specific roles of the management body; (2) credit risk appetite, strategy and credit risk limits, explaining how these concepts fit into the institutions' overall risk appetite framework (RAF) and strategy; (3) credit risk policies and procedures, setting out general and specific criteria to be considered in these policies; (4) the credit decision- making process, highlighting the principle of independence between different (e.g. business and risk) functions in decision-making; (5) setting out the requirements for robust and effective credit risk management and internal control frameworks, as part of the institutions' overall risk management and control frameworks; (6) the resources, skills and information technology (IT) and data infrastructure that institutions should have in place for prudent and robust credit decision-making processes; and (7) the application of general remuneration requirements to credit risk granting, with a view to mitigating excessive risk taking in lending activities.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_75942: In Section 4, the guidelines also set out supervisory expectations for institutions, when their lending activities involve leveraged transactions, technology-enabled innovations, use of automated models in creditworthiness assessments and credit decision-making, an approach to ESG factors and environmentally sustainable lending, and their data infrastructure. Furthermore, Section 4 refers to the application of the anti-money laundering (ALM) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) requirements in the context of credit granting. Institutions should note that loans that pose no credit risk may nevertheless pose money laundering (ML) and terrorist financing risk (TF) risk.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_75943: In these guidelines, the EBA is introducing prominently environmentally sustainable lending dimensions, and is setting requirements for institutions to consider ESG factors, environmentally sustainable lending and associated risks in their credit policies and procedures. This is a significant step considering the importance of the topic for the EU,

PARAGRAPH_75948: b. The focus of Section 5 is loan origination practices. It specifies (1) the handling and use of documentation of information and data from borrowers for the creditworthiness assessment; (2) assessment of borrowers' creditworthiness; and (3) setting out requirements for credit decisions and loan agreements. The section covers lending to consumers and, with a view to applying the principle of proportionality, provides specific requirements for lending to (1) micro and small enterprises and (2) medium-sized and large enterprises, including both secured and unsecured lending. A set of general requirements for lending to consumers is followed by asset class-/product-specific requirements, including lending to consumers secured by immovable property, lending to consumers secured by other property and unsecured lending to consumers.

PARAGRAPH_75949: Similarly, the section sets general requirements for lending to micro and small enterprises and medium-sized and large enterprises.

PARAGRAPH_75950: While all sections of the guidelines apply in relation to the granting and monitoring of all credit facilities, excluding derivatives, debt securities and securities financing transactions, Sections 5 and 6 apply in relation to loans and advances only. Furthermore, loans and advances to credit institutions, investment firms, financial institutions, insurance and reinsurance undertakings, central banks and sovereigns, including central governments, regional and local authorities, and public sector entities, are excluded from the scope of application of Sections 5 and 6, as the creditworthiness assessment of these borrowers would significantly differ from the assessment of traditional loans to consumers and enterprises.

PARAGRAPH_75951: c. Section 6 sets out supervisory expectations for the risk-based pricing of loans, listing a set of risk-based elements that institutions should consider and reflect when pricing newly originated loans, without prescribing any specific pricing strategies and interfering with business decision-making responsibilities. The objective of this section is to ensure that institutions implement a comprehensive framework for the pricing of loans. This section does not prescribe any particular pricing strategies, as that remains the business responsibility of institutions themselves.

PARAGRAPH_75952: d. Section 7 looks at the requirements for the valuation of immovable and movable property collateral (excluding financial collateral) at the point of origination of credit facilities as well as throughout the life cycle of the loans, including monitoring and revaluation (i.e. a review of the value of the collateral). In this section, the guidelines spell out supervisory expectations for independent valuers and conditions that allow advanced statistical models to be used by institutions for the valuation, monitoring and revaluation of various forms of collateral.

PARAGRAPH_75956: e. Section 8 of the guidelines focuses on supervisory requirements for the ongoing monitoring of credit risk and credit exposures, including regular credit reviews of at least medium-sized and large enterprises. In this section, the EBA also sets out supervisory expectations for the management information systems to be used for monitoring and the framework of early warning indicators/watch lists, thus building the link between the ongoing monitoring and early detection of loans with deteriorating credit quality that are also covered in the EBA Guidelines on management of non-performing and forborne exposures.

The guidelines are supported by three annexes presenting a set of considerations for credit- granting criteria (Annex 1), information and data needs for the purposes of creditworthiness assessment (Annex 2), and metrics that can be used in credit granting and monitoring (Annex 3).

PARAGRAPH_75958: Interaction between prudential and consumer protection frameworks

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:9]
PARAGRAPH_75959: 8. Sound lending practices employed by institutions for effective assessment of a borrowers' creditworthiness at the point of loan origination are important from both a prudential point of view and a consumer protection perspective. Failure to complete an accurate and thorough creditworthiness assessment may have negative consequences for institutions and borrowers, and affect overall financial stability, as borrowers may not be able to meet their contractual commitments under the loan agreements. As a result, the level of non-performing exposures in the markets may increase. The EBA statutory objectives include both prudential and financial stability as well as consumer protection. To this end, it is important that the guidelines reflect these objectives and address the issues of loan origination and creditworthiness assessments, from both a prudential and a consumer protection angle, as indicated in the Council's Action Plan.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:9] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_75960: 9. The creditor's obligation, prior to the conclusion of the agreement, to assess a borrower's creditworthiness is intended to protect consumers against the risks of over-indebtedness and bankruptcy, and therefore ensure responsible lending. The consumer protection perspective of these guidelines is of particular importance when specifying the requirements for the creditworthiness assessment in the context of lending to consumers and the collection of information and data for this assessment. The requirements of these guidelines provide further details on the creditworthiness assessment of consumers and the verification of consumer information, as laid down in Articles 18 and 20 of Directive 2014/17/EU when dealing with lending secured by residential immovable property and Article 8 of Directive 2008/48/EC when dealing with unsecured consumer lending.

PARAGRAPH_75965: Article 3 of Directive 2014/17/EU: EBA Guidelines on creditworthiness assessment9. Given the dual focus of the Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring, the EBA decided to fully incorporate the EBA Guidelines on creditworthiness assessment into the new guidelines and repeal them, with effect from the date of application of these guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:10] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_75966: 11. Incorporating consumer protection aspects into these guidelines and integrating (and repealing) the Guidelines on creditworthiness assessment under the MCD ensure that there is a comprehensive set of guidelines covering creditworthiness assessment from prudential and consumer protection angles, across different types of institutions, asset classes and loan products. This is of particular importance for institutions subject to the CRD, the MCD and the CCD (e.g. credit institutions offering loans falling within the scope of the MCD or consumer loans), which will need to implement only one set of guidelines on creditworthiness assessment.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:10]
PARAGRAPH_75967: 12. These guidelines take into account the EBA's scope of action, which has been amended through a review of the ESA Founding Regulations. The review brings Directive 2008/48/EC on consumer credits (the CCD) into the EBA's scope of action. The new EBA scope of action is applicable as of 1 January 2020, which means that the new scope is applicable before the application date of these guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:10] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_75968: 13. While taking into account the protection of consumers' interests, notably with regard to creditworthiness assessment, these guidelines go further, as they require institutions to also take account of those interests in the credit risk policies and procedures, credit-granting criteria and the design of the credit products that are offered to consumers.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:10]
PARAGRAPH_75970: 14. The implementation of these guidelines is subject to the principle of proportionality, and the proportionality principle is interpreted and applied differently for various sections of the guidelines. First, for the implementation of the requirements related to internal governance, risk management and control, institutions and competent authorities should consider a proportionality principle that is based on, inter alia, the size, nature and complexity of the institutions and other criteria set out for the purposes of the principle of proportionality, defined in the EBA Guidelines on internal governance.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:10] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_75971: 15. Second, when implementing the requirements for the creditworthiness assessment, collateral valuation and credit risk monitoring, competent authorities and institutions, instead of the size and complexity of institutions, should consider the type, size and complexity of the credit facilities being originated or monitored, because these are the main drivers that could give rise to a disproportionate application of the guidelines. Furthermore, the proportionality in the collateral valuation is also driven by the size, nature and complexity of the collateral and the relationship between the loan and collateral, whereas the degree of sophistication of the

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:11] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_75977: 16. The above differentiation in the application of proportionality aims to ensure that, while even smaller and less complex institutions have a robust and effective credit-granting process, loan origination and monitoring criteria are proportionate to the type, size, complexity and risk profile of the loans that the institutions are originating or credit facilities that they are monitoring.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:11]
PARAGRAPH_75978: 17. However, under the MCD and the CCD, the concept of proportionality and appropriateness applies in a general way, and not only in relation to size a loan has for the institution or creditor. This is because the main objective of these directives is founded on consumer protection. Building on that, and in order to ensure the full effect of these guidelines with regard to consumer protection, these guidelines also provide that the proportionate application to the size of loan, as set out above, should not result in any impairment of consumer protection, as envisaged in the MCD and the CCD.

PARAGRAPH_75979: 18. These guidelines apply from 30 June 2021, meaning that (1) the competent authorities should implement these guidelines by incorporating them into their supervisory processes and procedures, and (2) institutions should implement them in their business practices by 30 June 2021. The guidelines also envisage specific phase-in requirements for addressing data gaps in the monitoring of already existing credit facilities up until 30 June 2024.

PARAGRAPH_75980: 19. It should be noted that the requirements for loan origination in Section 5 of these guidelines apply also to loans and advances that already exist on the application date if their terms and conditions have been changed after the application date, provided that the changes follow a specific credit decision approval, and if their implementation requires a new loan agreement with the borrower or an addendum to the existing agreement.

Loan pricing should also be linked to the characteristics of the loan product and consider competition and prevailing market conditions. Institutions should also define their approach to pricing by borrower type and credit quality, and riskiness of the borrower (in the case of individual pricing) when appropriate. Institutions should ensure that the pricing framework is well documented and supported by appropriate governance structures, such as a pricing committee, that are responsible for the maintenance of the overall pricing framework and for individual pricing decisions when relevant.

PARAGRAPH_76585: 210. As a derogation from paragraph 209, for the purposes of a valuation of residential real estate in well-developed and mature property markets, the value may be assessed by means of a desktop valuation, carried out by an internal or external valuer and supported by advanced statistical models. The valuer remains responsible for the valuation, while the advanced statistical models should be used as supporting tools, meeting the conditions set out in Section 7.4, and including a confidence measure to indicate the robustness of the value proposal and other relevant property-specific information. In this case, the value proposal should be assessed, reviewed and approved by the internal or external valuer, who should understand all inputs and assumptions considered in the model. If the confidence measure in the supporting advanced statistical model indicates low robustness, and/or other property- specific information gives rise to uncertainty about the value proposal, the valuer should choose a valuation method other than desktop valuation.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:63] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_76722: 262. Institutions should assess risks associated with the refinancing of existing debt, monitoring loans with bullet/balloon repayment terms separately from other loans on a regular basis. They should analyse potential effects on a borrower's inability to roll over/refinance existing debt, and include inter alia a forward-looking macroeconomic outlook and access to capital markets as well as other types of debt structures. Institutions should closely monitor the borrowers' ability to repay or refinance their debts throughout a loan's lifecycle and not just when the borrower is approaching the end of a loan's term.

PARAGRAPH_77000: As part of the Council's conclusions on the Action Plan to tackle NPLs in Europe, issued in July 2017, the EBA has been mandated to issue detailed guidelines on financial institutions' loan origination, monitoring and internal governance, with a focus on issues such as transparency and borrower's affordability assessment.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:77]
PARAGRAPH_77001: Article 16(2) of the EBA Regulation provides that the EBA should carry out an analysis of 'the potential related costs and benefits' of any guidelines it develops. This analysis should provide an overview of the findings regarding the problem to be dealt with, the solutions proposed and the potential impact of these options.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:77]
PARAGRAPH_77003: The negative effects of the high level of NPLs in a substantial number of European countries can pose a number of risks to, for example, institutions' profitability and their lending activities, with an impact on the real economy and the financial system in the EU, and altering market perceptions of the European banking sector as a whole.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:77]
PARAGRAPH_77004: In addition to economic factors, the persistence of NPLs on institutions' balance sheets are influenced by structural drivers, such as institutions' lending and monitoring policies, supervisory action and transparency of the market for collateral assets28.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:77]
PARAGRAPH_77005: Before the 2008 financial crisis, substandard loan origination practices and weak monitoring played an important role in the build-up of NPL stock in a number of Member States. Furthermore, the lack of transparency in the market for collateral assets and of standardised valuation approaches has hampered confidence in the collateral system, which is essential to lending activities.

PARAGRAPH_77007: The main objective of the guidelines is to improve institutions' practices and associated governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms in credit granting, in order to ensure that institutions have robust and prudent approaches to credit risk taking, management and monitoring. In doing so, the guidelines aim to ensure that institutions are also prepared for the upcoming challenges in the EU banking sector, such as climate change and the transition to a more sustainable economy, and developments in technology-enabled innovation. Last but not the least, the guidelines aim to ensure that the loans that institutions newly originate remain of high quality while respecting and protecting the interests of consumers. Through achieving these objectives, the EBA aims to improve the financial stability and resilience of the EU financial system.

PARAGRAPH_77022: Under Option 1a, the monitoring of the performance of credit facilities and potential underlying collateral is based on the current EU legislative framework. The refinancing of existing loans will also follow the current standards and will not apply the standards for loan origination outlined in these guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:78]
PARAGRAPH_77024: It is expected that a broader scope of application would imply certain operational costs for institutions, such as costs associated with the development of IT and data infrastructure, especially for the creditworthiness assessment, and the monitoring of the stock of existing loans falling under the scope of application. It is also expected that these costs would be limited, as institutions have

PARAGRAPH_77028: the opportunity to collect the necessary information on specific loan agreements when a new contract or an addendum to an existing agreement is signed with the borrower. In terms of monitoring the stock of existing loans falling under the scope of application, the guidelines also allow a transition period of 3 years for institutions to take necessary steps as they identify gaps in their monitoring processes. This approach is also an effective way to tackle the credit quality issues on the stock of loans.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:79]
PARAGRAPH_77029: Limiting the scope to new credit facilities is expected to have a negative effect on the effectiveness and the consistent application of loan origination standards within and across institutions. This will hamper the creation of a level playing field and the convergence of supervisory practices. This status can prevail for a long time due to institutions' refinancing practices and outstanding loans with long maturity.

PARAGRAPH_77036: A diverse range of sector-specific market and policy factors has motivated the evolution of the sustainable finance agenda, with financial institutions developing methodologies and implementing procedures to integrate environmental factors into risk management systems, including customer credit and lending evaluations. These developments are coherent with the risk that environmental and climate factors pose for financial institutions, as close to 50% of the exposure of euro area institutions to risk is directly or indirectly linked to risks stemming from climate change29.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:79]
PARAGRAPH_77037: Approaches to incorporating those risks vary considerably in terms of scope and breadth of factors considered, governance and management, and relationship to broader sustainability strategies. Further barriers to sustainable finance and, more specifically, green lending are a lack of appropriate information flowing between the market and financial institutions and issues of policy coherence and regulatory alignment30.

It mandates the EBA to assess the incorporation of ESG risks into the supervisory process (Art. 98 of the amended CRD) and to assess the prudential treatment of assets associated with environmental or social objectives (Article 50da of the amended CRR). In addition, it requires large institutions to publicly disclose ESG- related risks they are exposed to. Furthermore, Article 8(1)(a) of the amended EBA Founding Regulation specifies that, when carrying out its tasks, the EBA may take into account the integration of ESG-related factors.

PARAGRAPH_77046: The adoption of ESG factors are expected to create one-off costs for institutions with regard to aligning their internal government arrangement or establishing those arrangements to be compliant with these guidelines, and will create ongoing costs for monitoring their ESG-related activities. In relation to loan origination, these costs will be limited to financial institutions that are active (or intend to be active) in green loan origination.

PARAGRAPH_77047: Supervisors are expected to face incremental costs when amending their practices, such as rules, methodologies and manuals, and informing staff members and the sector regarding these changes.

PARAGRAPH_77048: Including principle-based requirements on the ESG factors at the level of policies and procedures, however, will provide an opportunity to promote these practices from the point of origination. They will support counteracting the fragmented landscape of approaches on ESG lending, which present a barrier to coherence and comparability across institutions. By providing additional clarification on climate change associated risks, the guidelines support the creation of a clear understanding of green transactions.

PARAGRAPH_77049: Financial institutions are expected to benefit from the adoption of ESG factors in their loan origination practices, as including and monitoring environmental factors will help them to streamline the processes developed and to ensure that environmental and social due diligence is incorporated into credit decisions. This will help to take those risks adequately into account and thereby avoid or mitigate financial losses, reputational risk, and social and environmental harm.

PARAGRAPH_77050: Furthermore, the disclosure of green performance information by financial institutions and borrowers, including total green lending flows and the degree of adoption and implementation of core practices, is expected to support system-level monitoring and encourage a level playing field.

PARAGRAPH_77064: 1) MCD - Article 19; Recital (26)

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:81]
PARAGRAPH_77065: According to the MCD, valuation needs to meet valuation standards, in particular those developed by the International Valuation Standards Committee (IVSC), the European Group of Valuers' Associations (TEGOVA) or the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS).

PARAGRAPH_77067: Under the CRR, statistical methods may be used to monitor the value of immovable property and identify immovable property that needs revaluation (Article 208(3)). For the revaluation of collateral, statistical approaches can further be applied, in cases where Article 208(3b) does not apply, i.e. where there is no suspected material decline in the value of the immovable property and the loan does not exceed EUR 3 million or is less than 5% of the own funds of an institution. When Article 208 (3) does apply, a statistical model cannot be used as a sole means of undertaking the review of the property valuation.

PARAGRAPH_77077: The majority of Member States incorporate property valuation standards into their national regulatory framework. In at least seven Member States, additional guidelines apply, which detail the property valuation process beyond the EU specifications. The international and European valuation guidelines provided by RICS and TEGoVA are explicitly incorporated into more than six of these regulatory frameworks.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:82]
PARAGRAPH_77078: Three Member States specifically regulate the use of advanced statistical models.

PARAGRAPH_77079: The majority of EU institutions use advanced statistical models for internal portfolio valuation, mortgage revaluation and mortgage monitoring. In at least six jurisdictions, advanced statistical models are also used to support loan origination. In relation to the immovable property collateral, due to the statistical specifications of the models, the use of advanced statistical models is in practice restricted to the residential immovable property.

PARAGRAPH_77081: A broader use of an advanced statistical model throughout the life cycle of a loan may be beneficial for financial institutions from an internal business perspective, as they can carry out this valuation method for a range of valuation activities and thereby benefit from a quick and cost-efficient valuation.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:82]
PARAGRAPH_77082: In the future, it is expected that progress in information technology and the development of a large property and transaction database will increase the precision of advanced statistical models. A strict restriction on the use of those models could hamper development in this market and the overall progress of the valuation market.

PARAGRAPH_77083: However, from a prudential point of view, the use of those models at the stage of loan origination may create shortcomings in the risk management, so there must be prudential standards in place to ensure the transparency and accuracy of the model outcome. A strict ban on the use of advanced statistical models at the point of origination may increase the cost for consumers.

PARAGRAPH_77119: Summary of the BSG opinion

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:84]
PARAGRAPH_77120: The BSG was largely supportive of the EBA developing the guidelines and putting a dual focus on prudential and consumer protection aspects of loan origination. The BSG stressed that the guidelines should apply to new loans originated by all credit providers, including non-banks and new entrants.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:84]
PARAGRAPH_77121: One of the biggest areas of concern for the BSG was the application of the principle of proportionality and the level of application. The BSG noted the extensively wide scope of the guidelines and suggested focusing only on newly originated loans, not setting any new requirements for the existing stock of loans, as any information collection and analysis will be too burdensome and costly, and encouraging further integration with the requirements of the MCD, the CCD and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), in order to avoid any contradiction of the Level 1 legislation. To accommodate a more proportionate approach, the BSG suggested revising the language that makes the requirements very prescriptive.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:84]
PARAGRAPH_77122: The BSG requested more flexibility and recognition in the application of the principle of proportionality vis-à-vis the risk profile of the borrower, and the nature and complexity of the credit facility. Furthermore, the BSG requested for more differentiation in relation to requirements for retail and non-retail loans, risk-sensitive and non-risk-sensitive businesses, as well as the materiality of portfolios for the institutions. Furthermore, the BSG argued that the guidelines should adopt a more proportionate approach to the requirements for collecting data from the borrowers for the purposes of borrowers' creditworthiness assessment and monitoring. The BSG also requested clarification on the role and content of annexes in the guidelines, as they do not facilitate current market practices, such as portfolio analysis and model-based analysis, which are used for a certain group of borrowers and a large amount of small consumer/small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) credits. The BSG suggested including the content of the annexes in the guidelines as examples for the institutions.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:85] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_77126: The BSG suggested that the EBA consider extending the deadline for the implementation of the guidelines and introducing some phase-in arrangements. The main purpose of this is to allow the addressees of the guidelines sufficient time to make necessary arrangements to establish an adequate IT structure and provide training for the staff. Furthermore, the delay would also allow all other ongoing regulatory developments to be taken into account, including developments in the area of sustainable finance. With respect to sustainable finance, the BSG stressed the need to align all ESG-related requirements with the relevant upcoming ESG regulatory initiatives and the EBA mandates in CRR 2/CRD V and avoid front-loading the future regulatory requirements in these guidelines.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:85] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_77127: The BSG expressed concerns that the requirements for governance and credit granting are too standardised and prescriptive. It is argued that the guidelines do not clarify the difference between credit risk and creditworthiness assessment. On this point, the BSG suggested that the guidelines, instead of introducing detailed governance requirements that may limit proven and well- functioning lending activity, should focus more on protecting consumer interests, including assessing the suitability of products, protecting consumers from loan sharks and mitigating negative consequences of default. The BSG suggested that the EBA emphasise, in the guidelines, the concept of responsible lending.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:85] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_77128: Furthermore, the BSG made a series of suggestions to improve the consumer protection dimension of the guidelines. The suggestions aim to ensure that the institutions' credit policies and procedures and the creditworthiness assessment do not lead to discrimination against borrowers and appropriately take into account borrowers' characteristics (e.g. life expenditure, household composition), to ensure that the products are suitable for the borrowers and that loan servicing does not induce any undue hardship on the borrowers.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:85]
PARAGRAPH_77129: With respect to creditworthiness assessment, the BSG also suggested that there needs to be a clarification in the credit decision-making process between acceptance and refusal thresholds linked to default rates.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:85]
PARAGRAPH_77130: The BSG expressed concerns that the section on pricing is detailed and prescriptive, and that the requirements set out in the draft guidelines represent interference with business practices and decisions. The BSG requested clarification that the relevant section represents a set of best practices, as opposed to requirements influencing pricing strategies and decisions.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:85]
PARAGRAPH_77131: The BSG also requested more flexibility and streamlining of the requirements for the monitoring framework, as the proposal of the draft guidelines is perceived as overly complex, burdensome and not proportionate to the average size of the loan portfolios. Furthermore, the BSG expressed concerns that the general monitoring requirements do not adequately reflect the specificities of institutions, borrower groups and specific loan products.

PARAGRAPH_77139: Many respondents thought the draft guidelines were broad, in terms of topics covered, and prescriptive and put limitations on prevailing industry practices. To this end, respondents requested more flexibility in the requirements set out in the guidelines, recognition of different current and emerging industry practices and greater proportionality in the application of the guidelines, considering that the scope of the guidelines covers a wide range of loans, from small ticket consumer credit to lending to large corporates. The respondents also cautioned against creating a 'one size fits all' approach to credit risk taking, decision-making and creditworthiness assessment.

PARAGRAPH_77140: The application of proportionality

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:86]
PARAGRAPH_77141: Respondents not only noted three types of proportionality consideration in the guidelines but also requested that additional dimensions be considered, such as the materiality of portfolios, the risk profile of the borrower and the risk profile of the portfolio or specific loan. Many respondents requested that general proportionality considerations be supplemented with practical examples of how the principle of proportionality can be applied in practice. With respect to proportionality in the creditworthiness assessment, many have pointed to the idea of having simpler approaches when dealing with consumer lending and lending to SMEs, including recognising ongoing developments in model-based assessments and credit decisions. Furthermore, the respondents asked for the nature of the annexes and the widespread use of the words 'at least' throughout the text of the guidelines to be clarified.

PARAGRAPH_77142: The implementation timeline

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:86]
PARAGRAPH_77143: Many respondents requested a longer implementation period and/or transitional/phase-in arrangements. It was argued that the implementation of the guidelines would be costly and time- consuming, especially for IT developments and the collection of missing information from borrowers. Another argument for the delay was the ongoing and future regulatory developments and the need to ensure better consistency between the requirements of the draft guidelines and (future) Level 1 regulatory requirements. On this point, respondents suggested waiting for the finalisation of the reviews of the MCD and the CCD, in order to ensure consistency with future potential changes to the creditworthiness requirements set out in those directives. Respondents suggested that the EBA delay the introduction, in these guidelines, of any requirements for sustainable finance, green lending and ESG factors as part of credit analysis until the finalisation of other planned developments in the policy area, such as at the EU Commission Taxonomy or the EBA's ongoing and future initiatives and mandates.

PARAGRAPH_77150: Many respondents provided detailed feedback to specific sections of the draft guidelines. Thus, in relation to internal governance requirements, respondents asked for further clarification and alignment of the guidelines with the EBA Guidelines on internal governance, in particular with regard to points on decision-making, including independence in credit decisions that seemed to be too onerous. Respondents also requested the introduction of portfolio dimensions and the materiality of portfolios into the requirements for credit risk strategies, credit risk appetite and allocation, as well as clarification of how the 'three lines of defence' model fits into the process and list of tasks specific to the credit-granting process. With respect to the latter, specific concerns have been raised about the role of the risk management function in the credit decision-making process and blurring the tasks for the first and second lines, in particular, getting early independent risk views into the credit decision-making process. Respondents also noted that risk-based remuneration for staff working on credit seems to be problematic, especially considering the long- term credit quality dimension/metrics.

PARAGRAPH_77151: Respondents also asked for more clarity and guidance on interpretation and supervisory expectations in relation to the scope and wording of the requirements for technology-enabled innovation (FinTech), allowing for artificial intelligence (AI), big data and scoring models, etc., and running in parallel or replacing traditional human analysis of the financial position of the borrowers.

PARAGRAPH_77152: With respect to the proposed requirements for the creditworthiness assessment, respondents requested that the EBA revise the text to emphasise a more proportionate approach to data and information collection and creditworthiness assessment, first between small consumer credit and SME loans and lending to large corporates, and second between loans to new borrowers and loans to known/existing borrowers/customers. Respondents emphasised that the guidelines should also recognise different distribution channels, including online banking/products.

PARAGRAPH_77153: It was pointed out that the requirements for information collection and verification are too burdensome and sometimes not justified. Respondents expressed concerns that some of the requirements shift borrowers' responsibilities to institutions, and in some cases institutions are not in a position to obtain or verify the information. As for the creditworthiness assessment of micro, small, medium-sized and large enterprises, many respondents argued that, while some of the requirements, especially those related to financial projections and sensitivity analysis, may be appropriate for large corporates, they are not appropriate for SMEs.

PARAGRAPH_77157: Most respondents raised concerns about the section on collateral valuation, in which the guidelines restrict the use of advance statistical models/automated valuation for the valuation of immovable property collateral at the point of loan origination. Furthermore, respondents requested clarification and further elaboration on the definition and scope of immovable and movable property collateral, i.e. if the scope includes both when the property is used as principal collateral (asset-based lending) and when the borrower provides additional collateral at their discretion to strengthen their loan application (security lien). Respondents further raised a number of points in relation to the requirements on the rotation of valuers, a panel of experts and the application of the proposed requirements for leasing transactions.

PARAGRAPH_77158: With respect to the proposed requirements for monitoring, respondents stressed that the requirements are too burdensome and costly, because they require the monitoring of soft information and information that is not currently collected from borrowers. It was also stressed that monitoring requirements should not lead to additional supervisory reporting. While respondents largely support the approach to early warning indicators, they expressed concerns over the idea of having a minimum list of indicators to be monitored. It was also suggested to split monitoring requirements by segments (consumers, SMEs, etc.). Respondents also requested more clarity on what should be monitored at portfolio level and what at borrower and credit facility levels, as well as the focus of monitoring (behavioural aspects - repayment history - vis-a-vis monitoring of the financial conditions of a borrower). In relation to the monitoring, some have also raised concerns about the interaction of the proposed requirements with data protection rules, in particular in relation to the concept of a 'single customer view', used in both monitoring and creditworthiness assessment.

PARAGRAPH_77159: The EBA carefully examined all of the comments received (see the feedback table attached to this document) and amended the text of the guidelines accordingly. In particular, in response to the comments received, the EBA has clarified the scope of application of the guidelines. The EBA also extended the implementation period, with a view to giving institutions and competent authorities 1 year (between the publication of the final report and the application date) for the implementation and an additional phase-in period for the collection of missing information from the borrowers for credit-monitoring purposes.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:88]
PARAGRAPH_77160: The EBA significantly revised the guidelines and emphasised the principle of proportionality throughout. In order to account for the principle of proportionality, the EBA both changed the language/wording and restructured the sections.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:88] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_77161: First, the EBA revised the role and references to the annexes (e.g. the use of the word 'at least'), to ensure that they are not seen as a list of requirements/parameters against which supervisors should assess the institutions. Second, the EBA has split the section of the creditworthiness assessment of micro, small, medium-sized and large enterprises and set out a simplified approach to the assessment of micro and small enterprises, with significant simplification of the requirements. For this purpose, the EBA used the EU Commission's SME definition. Furthermore, the EBA has clarified that the creditworthiness assessment can be done by various means, including models, as long as the requirements of these guidelines are met. To this end, the EBA also provided

PARAGRAPH_77166: In the area of internal governance, the EBA has clarified the requirements for credit decision- making, and also the requirement for the use of FinTech and model governance, to ensure that the guidelines are both future proof and technology neutral. The EBA also revised the requirements for the credit risk management and control frameworks, to ensure their full alignment with the EBA Guidelines on internal governance and to avoid prescribing any specific organisational structures that remain the responsibility of the institutions themselves.

PARAGRAPH_77167: With respect to the loan origination procedures the EBA first clarified the requirements for handling information for the purposes of creditworthiness assessment, recognising that, for existing customers, information may be already available to the institutions, and then explained the notion of verification of information. The text has been thoroughly reviewed throughout, to ensure that there is no 'one size fits all' approach, and various approaches, including models, can be exploited as long as they meet general prudential requirements set out in the guidelines. The requirements for creditworthiness assessment for consumer lending have been simplified, compared with other asset classes, to ensure a practical application of the principle of proportionality. The EBA also clarified the requirements for the creditworthiness assessment of leveraged transactions that have been previously scattered across various sections.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:89]
PARAGRAPH_77168: The section on pricing has been significantly revised to address respondents' concerns. The EBA clarified the requirements and emphasised that the EBA's intention is not to prescribe specific pricing strategies. The EBA also elaborated further on various risk-based metrics to be considered by institutions in their pricing approaches.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:89]
PARAGRAPH_77169: With respect to the collateral valuation, the EBA has further revised the guidelines to allow the use of advanced statistical models for the valuation of immovable property collateral at the point of origination, subject to the strict conditions for such use, as far as possible within the requirements of the CRR/CRD and the MCD. The EBA also provided a set of requirements for the advanced statistical models themselves.

[JURISDICTION:FINNISH] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:89]
PARAGRAPH_77170: Based on the feedback received, the EBA streamlined the requirements for the monitoring framework, introducing more proportionality and consideration of the risk profile of the borrowers and portfolios/individual loans. Further clarifications included the monitoring of soft information, behavioural aspects, leveraged transactions and the use of early warning signals.
