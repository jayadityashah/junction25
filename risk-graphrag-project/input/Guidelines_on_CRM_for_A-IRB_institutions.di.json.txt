[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_68217: The EBA's review of the IRB approach aims, overall, to reduce unjustified variability stemming from different supervisory and institution-specific practices, while preserving the higher risk sensitivity associated with internal models. The credit risk mitigation (CRM) framework is an integral part of IRB framework and consequently the application of CRM methods can be a source of variability. These guidelines aim to clarify the CRM framework in the context of the advanced IRB (A-IRB) approach. They thereby complement the EBA report on the credit risk mitigation framework, which was focused on the standardised approach (SA) and the foundation IRB (F-IRB) approach.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_68218: The industry, as well as the EBA in previous work, has identified a clear need for these guidelines. The EBA and the industry have flagged that the complexity of the current provisions under Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (the Capital Requirements Regulation, CRR) on the CRM framework raises a significant number of implementation issues. The abovementioned EBA report provided some clarity on the application of the CRM framework in the context of the SA and the F-IRB approach, but the analysis carried out by the EBA also noted the limited guidance provided in the current CRR provisions on CRM under the A-IRB approach.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_68219: Consequently, these guidelines provide additional clarity on the application of the CRM approach for A-IRB institutions, focusing on clarifying the application of the current CRR provisions for the eligibility and methods of different CRM techniques, namely funded and unfunded credit protection, available to institutions under the A-IRB approach. This is supplemented by additional detailed guidance on eligibility requirements and treatment of funded and unfunded credit protection.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_68220: The guidelines were subject to a three-month consultation period and have been developed in dialogue with the industry, which provided significant input on the current practices. It is the EBA's belief that these guidelines should help eliminate the unwarranted differences in approaches remaining in the area of CRM due to either different supervisory practices or institution-specific choices.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:3]
PARAGRAPH_68221: Finally, it has to be noted that while developing these guidelines the EBA took into account the final Basel III framework published in December 2017, which also includes revisions of some specific aspects of the CRM framework. Therefore, in order to avoid potential inconsistencies with the final Basel III framework, some parts of the CRM framework are excluded from the scope of the guidelines and are instead considered in the context of the EBA's response to the call for advice on the implementation of the Basel III framework in the EU.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_68227: 1. The European Banking Authority (EBA) has previously outlined its programme on the review of the IRB approach in the EBA's report and opinion on the implementation of the regulatory review of the IRB approach published in February 2016.1 After (i) reviewing supervisory practices, (ii) harmonising the definition of default and (iii) providing more clarity on how to model probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and defaulted exposures, including the estimation of downturn LGD, the credit risk mitigation (CRM) framework constitutes the fourth and last phase of this programme. Although these guidelines (GL) were not originally envisaged as part of the review, the need for these GL has been identified in the course of work aiming to clarify the CRM framework in the context of the advanced IRB (A-IRB) approach.2 They thereby complement the EBA's report on the credit risk mitigation framework3 (the CRM report), which was focused on the standardised approach (SA) and the foundation IRB (F-IRB) approach.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:4]
PARAGRAPH_68228: 2. In accordance with Article 108 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (the Capital Requirements Regulation, CRR), for exposures to which an institution applies the SA or F-IRB approach, the institution may use CRM in accordance with Part Three, Title II, Chapter 4 of the CRR (Chapter 4) in the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts (RWEAs). For exposures to which an institution applies the IRB approach with own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors, i.e. exposures under the A-IRB approach, the institution may use CRM in accordance with Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 of the CRR (Chapter 3). Due to these different requirements for the SA and F-IRB approach on the one hand and for the A-IRB approach on the other hand, the requirements for the use of CRM have to be considered separately.

PARAGRAPH_68238: 2 As clarified in the EBA's report on the credit risk mitigation framework, the Basel capital framework refers, for non- retail exposures, to the foundation IRB (F-IRB) approach, i.e. where institutions provide their own PD estimates and rely on regulatory parameters for the other risk components (LGD and credit conversion factors (CCFs)). In contrast, under the advanced IRB approach, institutions provide their own estimates not only of PD but also of LGDs and CCFs for estimating the exposure value for off-balance-sheet (OBS) items, subject to meeting minimum requirements, and calculate the remaining effective maturity where permitted. The CRR, however, does not explicitly refer to F-IRB or A- IRB, but instead talks of the IRB approach, whereby institutions have the permission to use their own estimates of LGD and conversion factors. The latter differs from the A-IRB approach, commonly referred to in the Basel capital framework, in that it also includes retail exposures (for which own estimates of LGDs and CCFs are mandatory, either as direct estimates or, for LGDs, derived from an estimate of expected losses and an own estimate of PD). These draft GL refer to the terms used under the CRR with relevant abbreviations where appropriate, for consistency and to avoid misunderstandings. Therefore, these GL use the term A-IRB to refer to the IRB approach with own estimates of LGDs and CCFs, and F-IRB to refer to the IRB approach without own estimates of LGD and CCFs.

PARAGRAPH_68243: 3. Increased clarity of the CRM framework is considered an integral part of the IRB review and reflects the feedback received from the stakeholders to the discussion paper on 'The future of the IRB approach' published in March 20154. One of the main takeaways from the consultation was that, while the EBA had been given mandates to develop technical standards on selected issues,5 there was an overall need to consider the functioning of the CRM framework as a whole. More specifically, the industry flagged the complexity of the current CRR provisions due to numerous references and cross-references that make it difficult to understand which provisions apply under which approach to credit risk.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_68244: 4. In the case of the A-IRB approach, some clarifications on the use of CRM have already been provided as part of the guidance for the LGD estimation in the EBA Guidelines on PD estimation, LGD estimation and the treatment of defaulted exposures (EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation) published in November 2017.6 However, there are still certain outstanding issues, which have not been addressed and where different interpretations and practices are observed.

PARAGRAPH_68245: 5. At the same time, the recent changes introduced through the final Basel III framework7 should also be taken into account to the extent possible. Indeed, in May 2018 the EBA received from the European Commission a call for advice (CfA) on the impact and implementation of the final Basel III framework. The revisions in the scope of the CfA include the revised standards in the areas of credit risk and, in particular, on some specific aspects of the CRM framework. In this context, any issues that may lead to inconsistencies with the current CRR rules or to a deviation from the final Basel III framework have been addressed in the EBA's response to the CfA8 (CFA report) and are therefore not included in these GL.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_68246: 6. With a view to supporting implementation of the legislation that is clear and consistent across institutions and jurisdictions, these GL therefore clarify the application of current CRR provisions regarding CRM under the A-IRB approach and should help eliminate the unwarranted differences in approaches remaining in the area of CRM due to either different supervisory practices or institution-specific choices.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:5]
PARAGRAPH_68247: 7. These GL are structured in three main parts: (i) Section 4, with general provisions, which aims to provide clarity on the scope of application of the CRM provisions of Chapter 3; (ii) Section 5, providing guidance on eligibility requirements for both funded credit protection (FCP) and unfunded credit protection (UFCP); and (iii) Section 6, on the treatment of FCP and UFCP.

This section focuses on carrying out a mapping of the articles in Chapter 3 detailing the provisions for the eligibility and methods of CRM at institutions' disposal for exposures under the A-IRB approach. The aim of this mapping is to shed light on the CRM framework as provided in the CRR, as stakeholders have raised concerns regarding the clarity of the framework as it currently stands.

PARAGRAPH_68268: 9. As mentioned above, the scope of application of the CRM framework is defined in Article 108 of the CRR. In particular, for exposures to which an institution applies the SA and F-IRB approach the CRM techniques may be recognised in accordance with Chapter 4, whereas for exposures to which an institution applies the A-IRB approach the CRM techniques may be recognised in accordance with Chapter 3. In this respect, the GL clarify that the requirements of Chapter 4 apply to exposures treated under the A-IRB approach only where explicitly cross-referenced in Chapter 3. Therefore, Chapter 3 applies to exposures under the A-IRB approach and, in particular (as also clarified in Figure 1):

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_68269: · Article 166(2) and (3) of the CRR state that institutions may recognise the effects of master netting agreements (MNA) and on-balance sheet netting (OBSN) respectively through modifications of the exposure value; in this respect, these GL clarify that the CRM effects of such techniques may be recognised only through adjustment of the exposure value subject to all the requirements of Chapter 4, including eligibility requirements and methods.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:6]
PARAGRAPH_68270: · Article 181(1)(c)-(g) of the CRR state that institutions may recognise the effects of FCP other than MNA and OBSN only in their LGD estimates; in this context, it is clarified that, for the purposes of estimating LGD according to Article 181(1)(c)-(g) of the CRR, the references to 'collateral' should be understood as references to FCP other than MNA and OBSN. As MNA and OBSN are already recognised in the exposure value in accordance with Article 166(2) and (3) of the CRR, their effect should not be recognised again through LGD and hence they are also considered out of the scope of application of Article 181(1) of the CRR on own

PARAGRAPH_68274: estimates of LGDs. Requirements of Article 181(1)(c)-(g) of the CRR are also not applicable to UFCP, as these are governed separately in Article 183 of the CRR.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_68275: . While the term 'collateral' is not defined in the CRR, the definitions of FCP and UFCP are provided in Article 4(1)(58) and (59) of the CRR. According to the definitions provided, the fundamental difference between the two types of credit protection lies in the type of risk the protection receiver is exposed to: in the case of FCP, the lending institution bears the risk that the collateral received deteriorates in value, thereby resulting in a lower level of protection, while, in the case of UFCP, the lending institution bears the risk that the protection provider is not able to pay upon default of the obligor. For this reason separate requirements have been specified regarding the recognition of these two different types of credit protection.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_68276: . The method for the recognition of UFCP by institutions using the A-IRB approach has been specified in Article 160(5) and Article 161(3) of the CRR for non-retail exposures and in Article 163(4) and Article 164(2) of the CRR for retail exposures. These articles clarify that UFCP may be recognised by adjusting PD or LGD estimates in accordance with Article 183(2) and (3) of the CRR and under the constraint that the resulting adjusted risk weight should not be lower than the risk weight that the institution would assign to a comparable direct exposure to the guarantor9 (the risk weight floor). Alternatively, where the requirements under Articles 202 and 217 of the CRR are met, institutions may recognise the effects of UFCP in accordance with Article 153(3) and Article 154(2) of the CRR, the 'double default' formula (applicable to exposures under both the F-IRB and A-IRB approaches). In this respect, Article 161(4) and Article 164(3) of the CRR provide clarifications on the LGD to be used in the double default formula provided by Article 153(3) of the CRR. Finally, it is clarified that the recognition of UFCP in accordance with Article 160(4) and Article 161(1)(c) of the CRR is applicable only where institutions use the F-IRB approach and are therefore out of the scope of these GL.

PARAGRAPH_68277: 10. An additional clarification relates to treatment of credit insurance. In particular, focusing on the economic substance of the financial agreement, in accordance with paragraph 36 of the CRM report and Q&A 2014_768,10 it is clarified that, in the context of the A-IRB approach, credit insurance may be recognised as a guarantee (or a credit derivative) where it effectively functions in an equivalent manner. Since the CRR does not give a definition of guarantees or credit derivatives, it is furthermore clarified that in order to consider credit insurance equivalent to UFCP, and therefore as requiring the same eligibility and adjustment criteria for UFCP as included in Article 183(1)-(3) of the CRR, the credit insurance has to meet the UFCP definition given in Article 4(1)(59) of the CRR. In particular, which specific point of Article 183

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:7]
PARAGRAPH_68278: 9 It should be noted that in line with the CRR wording the terms 'guarantor' and 'guarantee' are sometimes used to include both guarantees in the strict sense as well as credit derivatives and, therefore, as synonyms for 'protection provider' and 'UFCP' respectively. In this respect, for example, the reference to comparable direct exposures to guarantor should be understood as referring to comparable direct exposures to protection provider.

PARAGRAPH_68279: 10 This Q&A (https://eba.europa.eu/single-rule-book-qa/-/qna/view/publicId/2014_768) specifies that credit insurance can qualify as a guarantee, but that this depends on the circumstances of the individual case and on the intrinsic characteristics of the contract and its economic substance.

PARAGRAPH_68284: 11.Regarding the scope of application of these GL, it is moreover clarified that it does not include potential support from third parties to the obligor, which can be reflected in accordance with paragraphs 62 to 64 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation, as it does not constitute a CRM technique. Therefore, the treatment of rating of third parties is not considered a method for recognising CRM. In particular, the rating transfer of paragraph 62(a) of those guidelines, i.e. the reference to 'appropriate guarantee', reflects support provided by the third party to the obligor and not to the institution itself, as would be the case under the definition of UFCP as a form of CRM technique given in points (57) and (59) of Article 4(1) of the CRR.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:8]
PARAGRAPH_68285: 12.It should be noted in this context that providing support by a third party to the obligor does not require any action from the lending institution and if it is efficient it may decrease the PD of the obligor. In contrast, CRM is a protection provided for the lending institution and, in accordance with Article 178(1) of the CRR, as further clarified in the EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default, the use of CRM is an indication of default of the obligor.

In accordance with these provisions the A-IRB institutions are required to ensure that the CRM meets the fundamental elements of the eligibility criteria, while at the same time the hierarchy of the approaches is maintained by allowing a broader range of CRM techniques to be recognised under the A-IRB approach than under the less sophisticated approaches. Under the SA and F-IRB approach, the eligibility requirements of Chapter 4 are very restrictive considering the limitations of the methods for the recognition of CRM. Under the A-IRB approach, the risk sensitivity is enhanced through broader eligibility of CRM techniques provided that institutions can adequately reflect their effects in the LGD estimates.

With regard to FCP (other than OBSN and MNA), Article 181(1)(f) of the CRR establishes that, if collateral is taken into account in the LGD estimation, institutions should set internal requirements for collateral management, legal certainty and risk management that are 'generally consistent with those set out in Chapter 4, Section 3'. The lack of guidance on the concept of general consistency is an issue that has been highlighted by the industry as being a source of uncertainty and variability in the application of the CRR provisions with respect to CRM for exposures treated under the A-IRB approach (A-IRB exposures). Some clarification has already been provided in Article 55 of the Final draft regulatory technical standards on the specification of the assessment methodology for competent authorities regarding compliance of an institution with the requirements to use the IRB Approach in accordance with

PARAGRAPH_68297: i. In terms of general principles on legal certainty applicable to all collateral used in LGD estimation, institutions should establish internal requirements that ensure that the collateral agreement is legally effective and enforceable, i.e. ensuring the power of the creditor to enforce the realisation of the collateral. Institutions should have the right to liquidate or take legal possession of the collateral even in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the obligor and, where applicable, of the custodian holding the collateral (i.e. where the bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian coincides with the default of the obligor). The enforced liquidation or repossession of collateral should be possible in a 'reasonable timeframe (in line with Article 210(a))' considering the market and legal environment in a relevant jurisdiction.

PARAGRAPH_68304: institutions should consider in satisfying the requirement of full consistency in Article 55 of the RTS on AM and, consequently, in satisfying the requirement of general consistency in Article 181(1)(f) of the CRR. It is worth noting that the general principles provided for all types of collateral are based on the eligibility requirements of Chapter 4, Section 3. This implies that full compliance with the legal certainty and collateral valuation requirements of Chapter 4, Section 3, for those collaterals that are included in one of the broad categories presented in that section, would ensure also compliance with these general principles. The GL do not provide any specific mapping for risk management requirement, as ensuring legal certainty, valuation of collateral and regular review of the value is considered to be part of overall risk and collateral management. Finally, further requirements on valuation of eligible collaterals are included in line with Article 229 of the CRR. While the reference in Article 181(1)(f) is only to Section 3 of Chapter 4, the requirements in this section referring to 'valuation', especially those of Article 208(3) and Article 210(g) relevant to immovable property and other physical collaterals, have to be read together with Article 229 of the CRR. Therefore, in order to ensure consistency and comprehensiveness of the requirements it is clarified that the principles specified in Article 229 of the CRR always apply to both initial valuation and any subsequent re-evaluation under all approaches, including under the A-IRB approach. However, while Article 208(2) and (3) of the CRR always applies, the requirements of paragraph 19(b) of the GL on valuation and revaluation of immovable property collaterals should be understood as applying only to valuation and revaluation of immovable property collaterals conducted after the application date of these GL (1 January 2022), consistently with the Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring12.

Moreover, the GL specify that the opinion should be provided in a written form by a legal counsel who is independent from the credit decision process and is not responsible for originating or renewing the exposures under consideration.

PARAGRAPH_68306: 18.It is further clarified that the legal opinion should be obtained by the institution at least for each type of collateral arrangement rather than for each specific collateral arrangement. Where a single legal opinion is issued for multiple collateral arrangements, that legal opinion must relate to the same applicable law and must be in relation to the same type of obligor. Any substantive variation to the terms of the collateral arrangement that could affect the legal effectiveness and enforceability of the specific collateral arrangement should trigger the need for an additional legal opinion. In this respect the GL clarify that, at a minimum, changes in the legal framework applicable to the collateral arrangements and application of the collateral arrangement to other types of exposures or to obligors classified to other exposure classes should always be considered cases of substantive variation to the terms of the contract.

Therefore, as an example, the application of the collateral arrangement, which is normally used for exposures to individual persons, to an exposure to an SME should be considered a substantive variation of the contract and should be accompanied by a new legal opinion. On the contrary, the application of such collateral arrangements to exposures to other individual persons should not be considered a substantive variation of the contract and would not require a new legal opinion.

PARAGRAPH_68313: 19.While it is important to ensure legal certainty of the CRM techniques, especially when they are recognised in the calculation of own funds requirements, the EBA recognises that assessing legal certainty may be challenging, in particular in cases where the collateral has the form of a movable physical asset. The GL provide principles for institutions on how to achieve a sufficient level of legal certainty while avoiding excessive burden and unjustified costs. In particular, the GL specify a minimum list of jurisdictions that should be considered relevant for a given physical collateral other than immovable property, and for which the legal opinion should be provided. In addition, institutions should consider whether for a given collateral there are also other jurisdictions that should be considered relevant.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:11]
PARAGRAPH_68314: 20. The list of jurisdictions that should be considered relevant includes the jurisdiction where it is most likely that the realisation of the collateral would be carried out, should this be necessary. While in some cases it may not be easy to foresee the place of realisation of collateral, the choice of this most likely jurisdiction could be based on one of the following considerations:

PARAGRAPH_68320: 21.It should be noted that the GL do not require a separate legal opinion for each relevant jurisdiction. Where possible, institutions may rely on a single legal opinion covering several jurisdictions.

Such regulations would typically have a form of an international convention that has been adopted or confirmed by a number of jurisdictions. The assessment based on

PARAGRAPH_68326: 22. With regard to UFCP, Article 183(1)(c) of the CRR establishes legal certainty requirements for the assessment of guarantees and credit derivatives. In particular, it requires that the guarantee14 is (i) documented in writing; (ii) non-cancellable on the part of the guarantor; (iii) in force until the obligation is satisfied in full (to the extent of the amount and tenor of the guarantee); and (iv) legally enforceable against the guarantor. These requirements aim to ensure that the guarantees are binding on all parties (i.e. legally effective) and that the creditor has the power to realise the guarantee (i.e. it is legally enforceable). In addition, Article 183(1)(a) and (b) of the CRR provide rules related to the eligibility of the guarantors.

In particular, the GL clarify that this legal opinion should be obtained by the institution for each type of UFCP contract rather than for each specific UFCP contract (noting that a single legal opinion can be obtained for multiple UFCP contracts, if they are subject to the same applicable law). The opinion should be provided in written form by a legal counsel who is independent from the credit decision processes responsible for originating or renewing the exposures under consideration.

Guidance on how FCP other than MNA and OBSN should be recognised in the institutions' LGD estimates has already been provided in the EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation. It is important to highlight that the relevant requirements with respect to the estimation of risk parameters also apply when recognising CRM techniques using own LGD estimates, including that the relevant data must be collected and stored, the estimates must be based on material risk drivers and empirical evidence and not only on judgemental considerations, and the estimates must be validated against the observed loss experience. The burden of proof of adequacy and compliance with these requirements rests on the institutions.

The GL also clarify that FCP other than MNA and OBSN cannot be recognised in the exposure value but may be recognised in the institutions' LGD estimates in accordance with letters (c)-(g) of Article 181(1) of the CRR and the guidance provided in the EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation. It should be noted that, whereas institutions are required to collect information about the cash flows and allocate them to the specific collateral in accordance with paragraph 114 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation, this should not constitute a constraint on the institutions' design of LGD models, which are not required to be based on components such as secured LGD and unsecured LGD.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:13]
PARAGRAPH_68337: 27. Article 166(2) and (3) of the CRR clarifies that the effects of MNA and OBSN should be recognised in the exposure value in accordance with Chapter 4. For MNA this implies that institutions may use the supervisory volatility adjustments approach or the own estimates volatility adjustments approach in Article 220 of the CRR or, subject to the permission of the competent authority, the internal model approach in Article 221 of the CRR in order to calculate the fully adjusted exposure value (E*) to be used for the purposes of RWEA and expected loss (EL) calculation. For OBSN, as clarified in the GL, institutions may also calculate the E* to be used for the purposes of RWEA and EL calculation. However, in contrast to the treatment of MNA, for OBSN the E* should be calculated in accordance with Article 223(5) of the CRR. In both cases (MNA and OBSN), the effects of netting are directly recognised in the E* and do not affect the LGD.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:13] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_68338: 28. In this respect, it is important to ensure that, for exposures that are covered by either OBSN or MNA, the netting is not double counted and that the associated LGD is estimated properly by institutions. Therefore, for both OBSN and MNA, for the purposes of RWEA calculation the E* obtained in accordance with Chapter 4 is multiplied by the risk weight assigned to the original exposure as if the exposure were not secured by OBSN or MNA. The same exposure value and risk parameters should be used for the calculation of the RWEA and the EL amount. In order to ensure proper estimation of the LGD, the GL clarify how to calculate the numerator and denominator of the realised LGD for exposures that are covered by netting arrangements. In particular:

PARAGRAPH_68354: . In accordance with Article 181(1)(c) of the CRR, in cases where there is a significant degree of dependence between the risk of the obligor and the risk of the collateral, such dependence should be addressed by institutions in a conservative manner. When the collateral provided by the obligor corresponds to one of its own liabilities (e.g. obligor's own bonds or equity) that ranks lower than or pari passu with the obligation of the obligor that they collateralise, in terms of seniority of the claim, this dependence is full. If the obligation is secured by the obligor's own equity, the dependence is always full. Therefore, consistently with the fact that such liabilities are residual claims with respect to the main obligation, the GL clarify that such collateral should not lead to any reduction in the institutions' LGD estimates.

PARAGRAPH_68366: ii. The substitution of risk parameters approach. This is understood as an extreme adjustment of PD and LGD, in which both the PD and LGD of the obligor are substituted with the PD and LGD that the institution would assign to comparable direct exposures to the guarantor whose direct exposures are treated under the A- IRB or F-IRB approach (A-IRB guarantor and F-IRB guarantor respectively).

PARAGRAPH_68374: 32. Having clarified the methods and approaches to recognise CRM in the institutions' risk parameters, it is important to ensure that institutions cannot choose arbitrarily among these approaches in order to reduce capital requirements. In this respect, rather than requiring institutions to use one of the specific methodologies described above, the GL clarify that institutions should have policies for assessing and recognising the effects of UFCP that are clear, consistent with their risk management practices and applied by institutions consistently over time and for a specific type of exposures. This means, for instance, that the substitution of risk parameters approach may be applied for the type of guaranteed exposures in which the collection and recovery processes assume these guarantees to be the first and main source of recovery. These policies should include a clear specification of the scope of application of each specific method/approach described above, i.e. for each rating system institutions should specify which approach applies. Consistency in the application of the methods for the recognition of UFCP is important in order to reduce arbitrage opportunities.

PARAGRAPH_68375: 33. Moreover, in order to ensure appropriate LGD estimation it was considered necessary to specify the treatment of ineligible UFCP. Similarly to the case of ineligible collateral, the inclusion of cash flows from ineligible UFCP in the calculation of realised LGD could potentially bias the unsecured LGD, if not monitored properly. It is therefore proposed to align the treatment of cash flows from ineligible UFCP to the treatment of cash flows from ineligible collateral as specified in paragraph 127 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation. In particular, as clarified in the GL, if the UFCP is ineligible, it should not be recognised using any of the methods specified above. Moreover, for the purposes of LGD estimation the cash flows received from ineligible UFCP should be treated as if they had been received without the use of UFCP, i.e. as if they were unsecured. However, institutions should in any case collect the information on these cash flows, monitor their levels and where necessary perform appropriate adjustments to avoid any bias in the LGD estimates.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:18]
PARAGRAPH_68407: 35. The GL clarify that, in adopting the modelling approach, institutions may adjust either the LGD only or both PD and LGD. Moreover, it is clarified that the simultaneous adjustment of PD and LGD should be limited to those cases where the adjustment of only the LGD does not fully reflect the effects of the UFCP and so the adjustment of the PD does not lead to double counting. The adjustment of only the PD parameters is not allowed in any circumstances, as this would be inconsistent with the requirement of Article 178 of the CRR that the need of the institution to realise any collateral or UFCP indicates default of the obligor (this applies also in cases where the guarantor takes over the original schedule of payments from the obligor). Based on this principle, any observations from past realisations of UFCP should be reflected in the estimation of LGD, and not PD, of the obligor. The UFCP may also have an effect on the PD of the obligor only if institutions can provide empirical evidence that the existence of the UFCP influences the behaviour of the obligor in such a way that the obligor is more likely to pay its obligations on time.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:18]
PARAGRAPH_68408: 36. Bearing in mind that the recognition of CRM effects under the A-IRB approach is ruled by Chapter 3 of Part Three, Title II, of the CRR, an important clarification included in the GL is that the adjustments of the LGD estimates should be performed based on historical experience (i.e. cash flows received from guarantors and costs associated with the realisation of the UFCP). According to Article 179(1)(a) of the CRR, LGD estimates should not be based purely on judgemental considerations. Therefore, institutions are not allowed to use pure theoretical models for the purposes of recognising the effects of UFCP in their risk parameters. That said, if historical experience and empirical evidence are the main driver of the adjustments of the grades, pools or LGD estimates, human judgement is also important in ensuring the appropriateness of the models and assumptions, as specified in Section 4.3 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation. Any theoretical assumptions used should be adequately calibrated and back-tested by the institutions.

PARAGRAPH_68412: Substitution of risk parameters approach

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:19]
PARAGRAPH_68413: 37. The substitution of risk parameters approach is understood for A-IRB exposures as an extreme adjustment of the PD and LGD of the original exposure that implies the treatment of a guaranteed exposure as if it were a direct exposure to the guarantor. In order to ensure consistency with the application of the same approach to exposures that are treated under the F-IRB approach, the GL clarify that, for the purposes of applying the substitution of risk parameters approach, the UFCP should be eligible in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 4. Moreover, two additional conditions for the use of the substitution of risk parameters approach are envisaged. The first additional condition is that the costs of exercising the UFCP should be expected to be negligible compared with the amount of the credit protection provided. Otherwise, it would be more prudent to reflect the effects of such UFCP and related costs through adjustment of the LGD estimates via the modelling approach. The second additional condition is that the guarantor is in a non-defaulted status. In this respect it is important to clarify that, in the event of default of the guarantor during the lifetime of the loan, institutions applying the substitution of risk parameters approach should treat the exposure as unsecured (i.e. not covered by this UFCP). It is considered inappropriate to use risk parameters of a defaulted guarantor for an exposure to a performing obligor. Furthermore, as the rating system is subject to the substitution of risk parameters approach, institutions would not be able to reflect the effect of such guarantee in the LGD of the obligor. It can be noted that, under the modelling approach too, such cases should be treated with caution, as it is expected that limited data are available to support the estimates where both obligor and guarantor default.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:19]
PARAGRAPH_68414: 38. A number of specific clarifications are provided for the application of both the substitution of risk parameters approach and the substitution of risk weight approach. In particular:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:19] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_68415: . Institutions should continue to collect and store information related to the classification and performance of the obligor and the exposure (i.e. all data relevant to PD and LGD estimation) and use this information in the estimation of the PD of the obligor. This aspect has also been clarified in Chapter 5 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation. This is to ensure that institutions use all relevant information and all available default observations in the estimation of the PD of the obligor.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:19] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_68416: . Institutions should consider the nature of the obligor for internal risk management purposes, recognising the different nature and, therefore, separately assessing direct and indirect exposures towards the guarantors. Given that the exposures guaranteed by certain entities may have significantly different risk profiles from direct exposures to such entities, institutions should be able to analyse these different risk profiles and, if necessary, adapt their credit policies. Institutions should also be able to analyse whether the processes of collecting the payments are similarly efficient in cases of direct and indirect exposures and hence they should be able to assess whether the use of the substitution approach is appropriate

PARAGRAPH_68420: · Institutions should define ex ante a separate scope of application of the LGD model and calculate separately the risk weight for the type of guaranteed exposures or part of exposures that will be treated in accordance with the substitution of risk parameters approach or the substitution of risk weight approach and that will therefore be assigned to the PD and LGD of a comparable direct exposure to the guarantor or the risk weight of the guarantor respectively.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:20]
PARAGRAPH_68421: This is supported by the fact that institutions are treating the part of the exposure that is covered by the UFCP as a direct exposure towards the guarantor for risk management purposes. Assigning different PDs to different parts of the exposure (as in the substitution of risk parameters approach, where the guaranteed part receives the PD of the guarantor and the unguaranteed part the PD of the obligor) implies that the calculation of risk weight should be performed separately for the part of the exposure that is covered by the UFCP and also, therefore, the computation of the LGD. This is supported by Article 172(1)(e)(ii) of the CRR, which allows different PDs to be assigned to the parts of exposures covered by a guarantee. The separate calculation of risk weight is a direct consequence of the use of a different PD and is equivalent to using a different risk weight under the substitution of risk weight approach envisaged in Article 183(4) of the CRR for A-IRB exposures covered by UFCP provided by SA guarantor.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:20]
PARAGRAPH_68422: It is important to note that using a different risk weight for a part of exposure due to the existence of a guarantee is an exception to the general rule that the risk weight should be calculated in accordance with the formula laid out in Articles 153 and 154 of the CRR and taking into consideration the full amount of the exposure. In fact, as also clarified in Q&A 2016_256015 for retail exposures secured by immovable property, in cases of exposures that are partially secured by FCP, institutions should calculate the RWEA in accordance with either Article 153 or Article 154 considering the full exposure.

PARAGRAPH_68423: It should be noted that the exception made for exposures that are partially secured by UFCP and to which institutions apply the substitution of risk parameters approach goes in the direction of the treatment proposed for F-IRB exposures covered by a guarantee (Article 236 of the CRR), which is proposed to be an option open to A-IRB institutions in the final Basel III framework published in December 2017. Finally, it is important to note that the exception described above refers only to the use of risk parameters and the calculation of the risk weight and EL.

PARAGRAPH_68424: 39. While the PD estimates are relevant to the obligors and hence all observations should be used regardless of the approach used to recognise the UFCP, the LGD estimates are specific to specific types of facilities. The facilities covered by UFCP may be treated as under the scope of a separate LGD model. Therefore, it is clarified that, for such guaranteed exposures under the substitution of risk parameters approach, institutions are not required to estimate the LGD parameters other than the LGDs of comparable direct exposures to the guarantor.

PARAGRAPH_68429: 40. The GL provide clarifications on how to apply the substitution of risk parameters approach in the case of guarantees that only partially cover the exposure value. This is also presented in the example in Figure 3, which describes a student loan that benefits from a guarantee covering 50% of the loan. The GL clarify that institutions should be able to split the exposure into two separate parts:

PARAGRAPH_68430: . The part of the exposure covered by the UFCP, to which they apply the substitution of risk parameters approach, and which will be within the separate scope of application of the LGD model. In Figure 3 the 50% of the student loan towards obligor A will be assigned to the scope of application of LGD model 1 for exposures to which the substitution of risk parameters approach is applied, where the PD and the LGD of comparable direct exposures to the guarantor are used.

PARAGRAPH_68431: . The part of the exposure that is not covered by the UFCP (in the example, the remaining 50% of the student loan, which does not benefit from the guarantee), to which institutions should assign the PD and LGD estimates applicable to exposures that do not benefit from UFCP, and which is assigned to the scope of application of the LGD model relevant to exposures that do not benefit from UFCP. For the purposes of LGD estimation this part of the exposure will be treated as if it were a separate facility.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:21]
PARAGRAPH_68432: The PD of the obligor is estimated at the level of the obligor and hence for this purpose the exposure should not be split. In Figure 3 the whole student loan is in the scope of application of the PD model and should be treated as one observation. However, this PD estimate is used only in the calculation of the risk weight for the unsecured part of the exposure. The risk weight for the part of the exposure covered by the UFCP under the substitution of risk parameters approach is calculated separately, with the use of risk parameters of the comparable direct exposure to the guarantor. It has to be stressed that such split of exposure and separate calculation of the risk weight is possible only due to the existence of a UFCP and the use of the substitution of risk parameters approach, and that it is not allowed under the modelling approach.

PARAGRAPH_68445: 41. For the purposes of properly estimating the LGD on the part of the exposure that is not covered by the UFCP, institutions should be able to adequately split the cash flows and costs. This will allow the calculation of realised LGD only on the part of exposure not covered by the UFCP, as if it were a separate facility. The GL provide guidance on how institutions should split cash flows and costs between the part of the exposure that is covered by the UFCP, and to which the substitution of risk parameters approach is applied, and the part of the exposure that is not covered by the UFCP.

PARAGRAPH_68446: 42. It is important to note that, in cases of a UFCP provided by a SA guarantor that only partially covers the exposure, under the substitution of risk weight approach, the risk weight of the guaranteed part of the exposure is applied in accordance with the SA while the risk weight of the remaining part of the exposure is calculated in accordance with the A-IRB approach. In this case, in order to correctly calculate the RWEA for each part of the exposure, it is necessary not only to calculate the appropriate risk weight but also to determine the exposure value, which is defined differently under the SA and under the IRB approach. Under the SA the appropriate portion of specific credit risk adjustments (SCRA) should be deducted from the exposure value while under the IRB approach the SCRA are part of the exposure value. The allocation of SCRA between the guaranteed and not guaranteed parts of the exposure is therefore important, since it affects the final RWEA. Whereas the GL provide guidance on how to allocate CRM, costs and cash flows, they do not include guidance on how to allocate SCRA. This is addressed in the CfA report, where the suggestion was to allocate SCRA first to the unsecured part. However, since the GL should not pre-empt any potential decision that may be taken in that regard by the Commission, it has been decided to keep this issue out of the scope of the GL.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:22]
PARAGRAPH_68447: 43. The substitution of risk parameters approach assumes the treatment of a guaranteed exposure as if it were a direct exposure to the guarantor. In order to appropriately reflect such treatment in the resulting risk weight, it is necessary to substitute both the PD and LGD parameters. In a specific case of an exposure to a defaulted obligor that still benefits from a valid guarantee, the same principle can be followed only by directly applying a risk weight applicable to a comparable direct exposure to the guarantor. Consequently, as the EL will be allocated as for a comparable direct exposure to the guarantor, there is no need to estimate another ELBE in this case.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:22]
PARAGRAPH_68448: 44. However, regardless of the use of the risk weight and the EL of a comparable direct exposure to the guarantor, the whole exposure to a defaulted obligor should be considered defaulted for the purposes of the calculation of the IRB shortfall or excess in accordance with Article 159 of the CRR. This is consistent with the treatment of these exposures as impaired in accounting.

PARAGRAPH_68449: 45. Irrespective of the methods and approaches chosen to recognise the effects of UFCP, institutions need to comply with Article 185 of the CRR and perform the back-testing of the risk parameters. This implies that institutions should back-test the adjusted risk parameters, PD and LGD, including the effects of the UFCP. This is straightforward if institutions apply the modelling approach and, therefore, the adjusted PD and LGD estimates reflect the risk characteristics of the guaranteed exposure.

In this case, back-testing the PD and LGD based on the performance of the exposure to the obligor would be meaningless. In particular, the observed default rate associated to the obligor would not correspond to the PD estimated for the guarantor. Therefore, the GL give more clarity on what additional quantitative validation tools can be used in order to ensure that the substitution of risk parameters approach has been applied correctly and that no bias stems from the utilisation of such approach.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:23]
PARAGRAPH_68454: 46. This additional validation tool consists of a comparison between (i) the observed loss rate on exposures where the obligors defaulted and that were considered guaranteed at the moment of default and (ii) the EL of comparable direct exposures towards the guarantor. This requirement covers the gap remaining after the application of the normal back-testing approach, which is performed only on the portfolio of direct exposures to entities such as the guarantor, but not to indirect exposures. Furthermore, the aim of this additional validation tool is to check the effectiveness of the guarantee and of the guarantor. If the results of this additional validation tool are negative, the institution should analyse whether this might be the result of lower than expected efficiency of the guarantee or the guarantor and whether the eligibility requirements are met. It should be stressed that, as the substitution of risk parameters approach is a method of PD and LGD adjustment, all relevant requirements for risk parameters estimates apply and institutions should verify, in particular, that the assumptions under which this method is used are met.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:23]
PARAGRAPH_68456: 47. The GL clarify that, in order to recognise the effects of the UFCP through overrides, institutions should be able to show that the nature and the non-modellable characteristics of the UFCP do not allow the use of either the modelling approach or the substitution of risk parameters approach. It is important to note that in most of the cases the override will affect the LGD of the exposure. If the PD is also adjusted through overrides, it is important to underline that the final PD is still a parameter of the obligor and does not reflect the PD of the guarantor. The PD of the obligor can be adjusted only if the factor taken into account through overrides is not reflected in the model, but influences the obligor's ability or willingness to pay.

PARAGRAPH_68457: Calculation of the risk weight floor

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:23]
PARAGRAPH_68458: 48. Article 161(3) and Article 164(2) of the CRR require that, where the effects of UFCP are recognised through adjusting the risk parameters, institutions should not assign an adjusted risk weight to the guaranteed exposure that is below the risk weight of a comparable direct exposure to the guarantor, which therefore acts as a risk weight floor. The GL clarify that the risk weight floor should apply any time the eligible UFCP affects the estimates of any of the risk parameters in such a way that it leads to a lower risk weight, i.e. any time institutions recognise the effect of the UFCP with any of the methods described in paragraph 31(a) of the GL. In this context it is important to clarify that the estimates may be affected in various ways, not only if there is an explicit risk driver in the model, but also indirectly in the calibration of LGD, if recoveries from guarantees are included in the realised LGDs of past observations and in this

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:24]
PARAGRAPH_68463: 49. The starting point for a proper application of the risk weight floor should be the determination of the exposure covered by the UFCP, i.e. the value of the UFCP. The GL clarify that, for the purposes of applying the substitution of risk parameters approach and for calculating the risk weight floor, the value of the protection should be specified in accordance with Article 233 and Article 239(3) of the CRR in order to properly include the effects of currency and maturity mismatches between the protection and the original exposure. In this way, like for the eligibility requirements, it is ensured that the substitution of risk parameters approach is applied consistently across exposures under the A-IRB and F-IRB approaches. It is moreover clarified in the GL that, after having included any maturity mismatch consideration in the calculation of the value of the UFCP, in order to avoid a double counting of the maturity mismatch, in the calculation of the risk weight of a comparable direct exposures to the guarantor the maturity parameter should be the same as the maturity of the exposure to the obligor.

PARAGRAPH_68464: 50. Where the UFCP covers only residual amounts remaining after pursuing the obligor and other forms of CRM, the amount that the guarantor has undertaken to pay is not defined ex ante in the contract. The GL clarify in this respect that institutions should estimate the value of the UFCP based on past experience in a conservative manner. This implies, for example, that, where institutions do not have enough data to perform reliable estimates of the residual amount, the amount of the UFCP should be assumed to be zero. Consistently with the requirements of Chapter 4 there are two exceptions from this general principle: (i) for residential mortgage loans under conditions specified in Article 215(1)(a); and (ii) for guarantees provided in the context of mutual guarantee schemes or provided by or counter-guaranteed by an entity treated as a sovereign under conditions specified in Article 215(2). In these two cases the UFCP value may be the maximum amount that the protection provider has undertaken to pay. These exceptions ensure that the GL would not create stricter rules for the A-IRB approach than those already existing for the SA and the F-IRB approach.

PARAGRAPH_68465: 51. The application of the risk weight floor to the adjusted risk weight obtained through the PD or LGD adjustment is straightforward in the case of UFCP that covers the whole exposure. On the other hand, additional guidance is necessary on how to calculate the risk weight floor in the case of a UFCP that only partially covers the exposure. In such a case the risk weight floor should be computed as an exposure-weighted average of the risk weight of a comparable direct exposure to the guarantor, weighted by the exposure value covered by the UFCP, and the risk weight of an exposure towards the obligor without the effects of the UFCP, weighted by the exposure value that is not covered by the UFCP. As an example, in the case of an exposure of 100 that is covered by a UFCP of 80 and where the risk weight of a comparable direct exposure to the guarantor is 15% and the risk weight of an exposure towards the obligor without the effect of the UFCP is 30%, the risk weight floor should be computed as follows: 15%*80+30%*20 = 100 18%. The risk weight floor always applies to the risk weight calculated for the whole exposure, as under the modelling approach and in the use of overrides the split of exposures is not

PARAGRAPH_68469: allowed. In the case of the substitution of risk parameters approach, in the calculation of risk weight the part of exposure covered by a UFCP is treated as a separate exposure to the protection provider. In this context, it has to be noted that the rules for deriving the parameters for comparable direct exposures to the guarantor have been specified in a consistent manner for the purposes of the substitution of risk parameters approach and for the risk weight floor.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:25]
PARAGRAPH_68470: 52. Following the same logic, the GL also clarify how institutions should compute the risk weight floor in cases of multiple UFCPs covering different parts of the exposure. In such a case, the risk weight floor should be the exposure-weighted average of the risk weights of comparable direct exposures to each guarantor and, if relevant (i.e. if the sum of the UFCP does not cover the full exposure, e.g. UFCP(A) + UFCP(B) < exposure value), the risk weight of an exposure towards the obligor without the effects of UFCP. As an example, in the case of an exposure of 100, where 40 of this exposure is covered by a UFCP provided by guarantor A and another portion of 40 is covered by a UFCP provided by guarantor B, and where the risk weights of comparable direct exposures to guarantors A and B are 10% and 15% respectively, and the risk weight of an exposure towards the obligor without the effect of the UFCP is 30%, the risk weight floor should be computed as follows: 10%*40+15%*40+30%*20 100 = 16%.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:25]
PARAGRAPH_68471: 53. Finally, the GL clarify how institutions should compute the risk weight floor in cases of multiple UFCPs securing the same part of the exposure. In particular, institutions should calculate the risk weight floor for this part of the exposure as the lowest of the risk weights of comparable direct exposure to each guarantor. In other words, institutions should perform the calculation of the risk weight separately with respect to each guarantor, considering the effect of the other existing UFCP in the LGD estimates of comparable direct exposures to the guarantor, and pick the lowest.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:25]
PARAGRAPH_68472: 54. As an example, consider an exposure of 100, where 40 of this exposure is covered by a UFCP provided by guarantor A, while 80 (including the 40 covered by guarantor A) is covered by guarantor B and the remaining 20 is unsecured. Therefore, in this example 40 is covered by both guarantors A and B, 40 is covered only by guarantor B and 20 is not covered by any guarantee. In order to compute the appropriate risk weight floor, the institution has to determine the risk weights of comparable direct exposures to both guarantors A and B. For the part of the exposure covered by both guarantees, these risk weights may take into account the existence of the other guarantee. In other words, the risk weight associated with comparable direct exposure to guarantor A may assume that this exposure benefits from UFCP provided by guarantor B. The risk weight associated with comparable direct exposure to guarantor B may assume that this exposure benefits from the UFCP provided by guarantor A, but only for the part covered by both guarantees. For the remaining 40 covered only by guarantor B, the risk weight of a comparable direct exposure to guarantor B should be calculated on the assumption that this exposure is unsecured. As a result: assuming that the risk weight for comparable direct exposures to guarantor A is 5% (and 3% when also considering the effect of guarantor B) and 10% for comparable direct exposures to guarantor B (6% when also considering the effect of guarantor A), the institution should pick 3% for the 40 of the exposure that is covered by both

PARAGRAPH_68479: 55. Another important clarification included in the GL relates to the recognition of CRM for exposures that benefit from multiple forms of credit protection, including cases where a single exposure is covered by both FCP and UFCP or multiple UFCP. In order to ensure consistent application of the modelling approach, the substitution of risk parameters approach and overrides, the GL provide a set of general principles that institutions should comply with, including the following:

PARAGRAPH_68480: · Institutions should have clear policies for the allocation of the FCP to different parts of the exposure, determining for example whether the FCP overlaps with the UFCP for which the substitution of risk parameters approach is applied; these policies should be consistent with the internal recovery and collection process.

PARAGRAPH_68481: · Institutions should not recognise the effects of CRM techniques more than once; this implies that, in allocating the FCP between the part of the exposure that is also covered by UFCP and the part of the exposure that is not, double counting of the FCP should not be allowed. Using as an example allocation A of FCP and UFCP in Figure 4, the application of the substitution of risk parameters approach should be such that, as depicted in Figure 5, the FCP of 80 should be considered in estimating the LGD of comparable exposures to the guarantor for the purposes of applying the substitution of risk parameters approach to the exposure value of 80 also covered by UFCP, while the LGD on the remaining exposure value of 20 should be estimated considering the remaining FCP of 10; similarly, in cases of multiple UFCP covering the same exposure, in allocating the UFCP between the part of the exposure that is also covered by another UFCP and the part of the exposure that is not, double recognition of the UFCP should not be allowed.

If the direct exposures to the guarantor are treated under the A-IRB approach, institutions should try to estimate the LGD of comparable direct exposures to the guarantor including the effect of the overlapping FCP (this is presented in the example of allocation A in Figure 4 and Figure 5, where the LGD of comparable direct exposures to the guarantor providing the UFCP of 80 should include the effects of the FCP of 80). If institutions are not able to perform this estimation, the two following alternatives are considered:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:29]
PARAGRAPH_68548: i. If the LGD of unsecured exposures to the guarantor is lower than or equal to the LGD of unsecured exposures to the obligor,16 then the institution should use the LGD of the exposure to the obligor including the effect of FCP as LGD of a comparable direct exposure to the guarantor. Taking the example of allocation A in Figure 4 and Figure 5, if the LGD of direct unsecured exposures to the guarantor providing the UFCP for 80 is lower than or equal to the LGD of unsecured exposures to the original obligor, then the institution can use the LGD of the exposure of 80 considering only the effect of the FCP for 80. The rationale behind this proxy is that, while the PD depends solely on characteristics of the obligor, the LGD is often mostly derived from characteristics of the exposure; in extreme cases, if the LGD estimation of an institution is solely dependent on characteristics of the exposure, the LGD will be the same irrespective of whether the exposure is held against the obligor or the guarantor, because the risk drivers will be the same as for the exposure against the obligor.

This is presented in the example in Figure 7 and Figure 8, where the LGD of comparable direct exposures to the guarantor providing the UFCP(B) of 40 should include the effects of the overlapping UFCP(A) of 20. If institutions are not able to perform this estimation, the two following alternatives are considered:

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:30]
PARAGRAPH_68560: i. If the LGD of unsecured exposures to the guarantor is lower than or equal to the LGD of unsecured exposures to the obligor, then the institution should use the LGD of the exposure including the effect of the other UFCPs as LGD of a comparable direct exposure to the guarantor. Taking the example in Figure 7 and Figure 8, this implies that, if the LGD of unsecured exposures to guarantor B is not higher than the LGD of unsecured exposures to the original obligor, the institution can use the LGD of the exposure of 40 backed only by the UFCP provided by guarantor A for 20; otherwise, institutions should use the LGD of unsecured exposures to guarantor B.

Moreover, in order to avoid cherry picking, the GL clarify that this choice should be made consistently for the type of exposures and not at the level of the individual exposure.

In accordance with Article 108(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions that apply the IRB approach by using their own estimates of LGD in accordance with Article 143(2) of that Regulation may recognise credit risk mitigation in accordance with Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 of that Regulation. Institutions may recognise credit risk mitigation in accordance with Part Three, Title II, Chapter 4 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 where those requirements are referred to in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 of that Regulation and in accordance with these guidelines.

PARAGRAPH_68655: 12. For the purposes of Article 181(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, any reference to the term 'collateral' should be understood as a reference to funded credit protection other than the funded credit protection referred to in Article 166(2) and (3) of that Regulation. This includes, in particular, funded credit protection other than master netting agreements and on-balance sheet netting. Credit risk mitigation effects of master netting agreements and on-balance sheet netting are reflected in the exposure value. Therefore, for the types of exposures where institutions have received permission to use own LGD estimates, institutions may recognise funded credit protection in accordance with Article 181(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 only where that protection has not already been recognised in the exposure value for the cases specified in Article 166 of that Regulation and in line with paragraph 13.

In recognising the effects of on-balance sheet netting and master netting agreements, institutions should take into account all requirements related to these techniques specified in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 4 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, including the eligibility criteria and the methods for recognising the risk mitigation effects of such instruments.

In particular, institutions may recognise the credit insurance according to Article 183(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Article 183(2) or 183(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 depending on whether credit insurance effectively functions like a guarantee or like a credit derivative respectively.

In particular, the appropriate guarantee referred to in paragraph 62(a) of those guidelines relates to a type of contractual support provided by a third party to the obligor and hence it does not constitute a credit risk mitigation technique used by an institution in the sense of points (57) and (59) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.

For the purposes of LGD estimation as referred to in Article 181(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and in accordance with paragraph 131 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation, institutions should calculate the realised LGD for each exposure that is covered by a master netting agreement or on-balance sheet netting as the ratio of the economic loss to the outstanding amount of the credit obligation at the moment of default calculated as E* in accordance with paragraph 27 or 28. Institutions should calculate the economic loss on the basis of this outstanding amount, and no cash flows from netting should be included as recoveries after default in the economic loss. Nevertheless, in line with paragraph 131 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation, it is important to recall that the outstanding amount of the credit obligation at the moment of default calculated as E* needs to include any amount of principal, interest or fee realised so far.

For LGD estimation purposes, the cash flows received from exercising the ineligible unfunded credit protection should be treated as if they had been received without the use of unfunded credit protection. Regardless of this treatment, institutions should collect the information about the source of the cash flows related to ineligible unfunded credit protections and allocate them appropriately. Institutions should regularly monitor the levels of such cash flows as well as the extent to which the relevant types of unfunded credit protection are used. Where necessary, institutions should perform appropriate adjustments in order to avoid any bias in the PD and LGD estimates.

PARAGRAPH_68799: 47. For the purposes of recognising the credit risk mitigation effects of multiple credit protections that, as a result of the allocation performed by the institution in accordance with paragraph 46, cover the same part of an exposure, institutions may use one of the approaches specified in paragraph 31(a). In particular, for the purposes of applying the substitution of risk parameters approach and calculating the risk weight floor, institutions should use the following methods to derive the LGD of a comparable direct exposure to the guarantor including the credit risk mitigation effects of the additional credit protection:

PARAGRAPH_68814: Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 (the EBA Regulation) provides that the EBA should carry out an impact assessment (IA) that analyses 'the potential related costs and benefits' of any guidelines it develops. This analysis should provide an overview of the findings regarding the problem to be dealt with, the solutions proposed and the potential impact of these options.

PARAGRAPH_68815: This analysis presents the impact assessment (IA) of the main policy options included in these Guidelines on credit risk mitigation for institutions that apply the IRB approach by using their own estimates of LGD in accordance with Article 143(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. The majority of the IA is high level and qualitative in nature, given the availability of data. The IA also draws on some data collected as part of the 2018 benchmarking exercise.

PARAGRAPH_68818: The EBA, in its Roadmap on the regulatory review of internal models published in February 2016, set out aspects related to CRM to be covered in a fourth and final phase. 19 So far, the clarifications to be provided on CRM in the context of the F-IRB approach and the SA have been agreed in the CRM report. Some aspects of the CRM framework in the context of the A-IRB approach have also been addressed as part of the GL on PD and LGD estimation.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:51]
PARAGRAPH_68819: Nevertheless, clarification on certain aspects of CRM under the A-IRB approach remains lacking, resulting in divergent practices and interpretations observed across countries. These divergent practices range from eligibility criteria applied for collateral to the methods applied for recognising UFCP, which ultimately could lead to unwarranted variability of own funds requirements for the same exposure across different institutions or jurisdictions, in turn distorting the level playing field across the EU, not only for banks, but ultimately also for borrowers through the effect this may have on banks' pricing and allocation of lending.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:55]
PARAGRAPH_68887: Article 183 of the CRR covers both LGD and PD estimation and its title explicitly determines the content as relating to UFCP. Article 181 of the CRR covers only the LGD estimation, implying that collateral can only be reflected in LGD estimates and that FCP does not affect the PD.

PARAGRAPH_68888: Verifying that Article 183 of the CRR does not cover too narrow a spectrum of aspects to be considered for LGD adjustment under UFCP,20 Option 2a has been chosen. Requirements related to collateral specified in Article 181 of the CRR should be read as covering FCP only, excluding master netting agreements and on-balance sheet netting (as these are reflected in exposure value in accordance with Article 166 of the CRR).

PARAGRAPH_68889: This reading of the term 'collateral' in Article 181 of the CRR as only FCP (other than netting) allows clarity in the CRR in that Article 181 covers FCP only, and equivalent requirements for UFCP are specified in Article 183.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:55]
PARAGRAPH_68891: For OBSN and MNA, the effects of netting could technically be recognised through adjusting the exposure value or through an adjustment of the LGD.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:55]
PARAGRAPH_68892: However, Article 166 of the CRR requires that netting should be reflected in the exposure value, which cannot be changed by the guidelines. This reflects the fact that netting agreements may be executed before the default and that the use of netting is not expected to lead to any significant costs for the institution. Option 3a, recognising OBSN and MNA directly in the exposure value, has been chosen, as it is better aligned with the requirements of Article 166(2) and (3) of the CRR. While Option 3b would lead to the same results in terms of RWEA, it was disregarded, as it would lead to inconsistencies between the OBSN and MNA, as well as inconsistencies in the recognition of netting between the SA and the IRB approach.

PARAGRAPH_68900: One way to address this would be to obtain a legal opinion on the legal enforceability and effectiveness of collateral in all jurisdictions the physical collateral is likely to move to during the lifetime of the loan. While this would imply a very thorough and complete assessment of the collateral, at the same time it would imply that the collateral contract would need to specify the entire set of jurisdictions the collateral could move to during the lifetime of the loan and that institutions would have to obtain legal opinions for each of them. Comparing the substantial burden this would entail for institutions with the value added this would provide for the collateral assessment, Option 4a has been ruled out. Similar considerations apply to Option 4b, due to potential difficulties in establishing the usual location of collateral depending on the purpose of its use. Option 4c has been chosen as the preferred option, according to which an assessment needs to be made for the jurisdiction where it is most likely that the process of realising the collateral would be carried out, should this be necessary.

PARAGRAPH_68902: Treatment of UFCP - modelling approach: adjustment of PD and LGD of the obligor21

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:56]
PARAGRAPH_68903: In Article 160(5), Article 161(3) and Article 164(2), the CRR leaves room for both the PD and LGD to be adjusted under the A-IRB approach for recognising the effects of UFCP. Furthermore, Article 236 of the CRR allows adjustments of both the PD and the LGD at the same time under the F-IRB approach. However, further clarification is needed on how UFCP should be reflected under the A- IRB approach, and under what conditions both the PD and LGD may be adjusted and how. It needs to be ensured that there is no double counting of the CRM effect, where the effect of the same UFCP is recognised both in PD and in LGD estimates.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:56]
PARAGRAPH_68904: Option 5b has been chosen as the preferred option. Banks modelling their own LGD, and UFCP being reflected in an adjusted LGD, is assessed as the most sensible option, since it allows maximum risk sensitivity. In exceptional cases, however, adjusting both the PD and the LGD of the obligor may also be appropriate. These would be cases where UFCP not only brings recoveries in the event of default of the obligor, but also influences the behaviour of the obligor, making the obligor more likely to pay its obligations in full. This approach is also reflected in EBA Q&A 2013_145.22

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:56]
PARAGRAPH_68905: Option 5c, in which adjusting only the PD is allowed, has been ruled out. The rationale for this is that adjusting the PD in order to reflect effects of a UFCP, but not then also changing the LGD, would not reflect the full effect of a UFCP. While the existence of UFCP may affect the PD of the obligor, it will never reduce it to zero and, as soon as the lending institution calls on a guarantee,

PARAGRAPH_68912: Ideally, one would have an understanding of the quantitative implications of the various approaches and from this get an understanding of the impact of different approaches on banks.

Since the substitution approach is the only possible method under the SA and the F-IRB approach, the CRR establishes detailed eligibility requirements for using UFCP under these approaches. It is considered appropriate to require that the same requirements should be met in order to use the substitution of risk parameters under the A-IRB approach. In addition to this, it has been assessed that the cost of exercising the guarantee also needs to be negligible, as otherwise any material costs related to exercising the guarantee would need to be reflected in the LGD estimate. In this case, the LGD applicable to direct exposure to the guarantor would not be appropriate and this difference should be reflected through modelling.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:58]
PARAGRAPH_68956: Furthermore, an additional restriction has been implemented in that, in order to use the substitution approach under the A-IRB approach, the guarantor cannot be defaulted. This additional condition is needed because the risk weight of a defaulted guarantor is not considered appropriate for an exposure to a non-defaulted obligor. It cannot be argued that the exposure can be treated as a direct exposure to the defaulted guarantor. Rather, after the default of the guarantor the exposure towards the obligor should be treated as no longer secured by that guarantee. Therefore, Option 6c has been chosen as the preferred option, and all three conditions need to be met in order for the substitution approach to be used under the A-IRB approach.

PARAGRAPH_68958: Articles 160 and 161 of the CRR do not establish a direct link to the substitution of risk parameters approach in the context of the A-IRB approach, as they use the wording of adjustment of PD and LGD only. This gives rise to the discussion of whether PD and LGD adjustment can also entail substituting the risk parameters and, if so, if it should apply only to the PD, only to the LGD or to both.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:58]
PARAGRAPH_68959: In order not to give preferential treatment to the F-IRB approach where substitution is allowed, substitution should be allowed for UFCP under the A-IRB approach, and it can be viewed as an extreme form of adjustment of risk parameters. Option 7a has been eliminated as a result.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:58]
PARAGRAPH_68960: At the same time, Option 7c has been eliminated, as it would not adequately reflect the risk profile of exposures covered by UFCP. Since the application of the substitution approach is like modelling a comparable direct exposure to the guarantor, substituting both LGD and PD of the guarantor is the only way that would be an appropriate reflection of a comparable direct exposure. If only substitution of the guarantor's PD were allowed, the LGD (of the obligor) would not correctly reflect the loss that would occur if the guarantor failed. Likewise, allowing substitution of the guarantor's LGD only, one would be treating the exposure as a direct exposure to the guarantor, but with an inappropriate PD (as the guarantor's PD is likely to be different from the obligor's PD).

This was followed by substitution of the guarantor's PD only (16), of the guarantor's LGD only (2) and of the risk weight (5). For guarantors treated under the F-IRB approach, the only bank applying the substitution approach applied the guarantor's PD substitution only. However, under the F-IRB approach the LGD values are uniform for all exposures; hence, the substitution results in a different LGD parameter only in cases of a difference in seniority between the underlying exposure and the UFCP.

PARAGRAPH_68968: The substitution of risk parameters approach can be used under the assumption that the exposures covered by UFCP are treated as direct exposures to the guarantor. As this should not change in the case of default of an obligor - just the opposite; it is likely that the exposure will actually become a direct exposure to the guarantor - Option 8c was disregarded.

PARAGRAPH_68969: Based on the assumption described above, it is considered that the appropriate risk weight for such exposure is the risk weight applicable to a direct exposure to the guarantor. Option 8b was considered in the context of the different risk weight functions applicable to defaulted exposures, which is based on the ELBE and LGD in default. Based on the risk weight and EL of the direct exposure to the guarantor, it could be possible to transform the risk weight function in such a way as to achieve the LGD in default. However, this was considered inappropriate and unnecessary and hence Option 8b was disregarded. Option 8a was chosen as the preferred option, as it is simple to apply and leads to appropriate levels of own funds requirements.

PARAGRAPH_68981: A key aspect to consider when reflecting FCP and UFCP in a bank's exposure and credit risk is the question of how far this can be done in a realistic and representative way. The answer to this in the context of substitution depends on how well an institution is able to model a comparable direct exposure to the guarantor, in order to arrive at the substituted guarantor's PD and LGD values.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:60]
PARAGRAPH_68982: In cases where an exposure is covered by several credit protections, either in the form of both collateral and guarantees (i.e. FCP and UFCP) or by multiple guarantees (i.e. multiple UFCPs), establishing an LGD estimate for a comparable direct exposure to a guarantor becomes quite difficult, given that such hypothetical exposure may not actually exist on the balance sheet of the institution. In the case of FCP and UFCP, for example, calculating the LGD for the comparable direct exposure to the guarantor would require finding an exposure to the guarantor that is collateralised by the same collateral as the original exposure.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:60] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_68983: Therefore, the question arises whether it should be allowed to recognise other existing risk mitigation techniques under the substitution of risk parameters approach, or whether banks should in this case be required to ignore any additional protection (i.e. not take into account the collateral or any additional UFCP when modelling the LGD of a comparable direct exposure to the guarantor).

PARAGRAPH_68995: The application of the above policy options by banks will have implications for how they determine their risk-weighted assets (RWAs) for exposures covered by FCP or UFCP and may influence their decisions to use either the modelling or the substitution approach.

PARAGRAPH_69033: While the overall number of responses is high, it has to be noted that most of the submitters did not respond to all of the questions and were focused on specific topics such as legal certainty of other physical collateral and the treatment of credit insurance. Only six respondents provided comprehensive feedback on all or most of the questions.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:64]
PARAGRAPH_69034: Most of the respondents focused on the eligibility requirements of FCP and the assessment of legal certainty (questions 1 and 2). In particular, negative feedback was received on the strict approach proposed for the selection of relevant jurisdictions for other physical collateral (i.e. the set of jurisdictions where the collateral could move during the lifetime of the loan according to the collateral agreement). The alternative approach considered in an explanatory box (where the relevant set of jurisdictions could be limited to those where the collateral is usually located depending on the purpose of its use) was evaluated as unpractical, since many physical types of collateral such as ships or aircrafts do not have a precise set of usual jurisdictions where they operate. Some of the respondents also pointed out the potential cost of having a legal opinion for each jurisdiction. Furthermore, it was also argued that it is not market practice to require assets to be operated or located within a limited number of jurisdictions. Moreover, the respondents brought to the EBA attention a number of international agreements, such as the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment, the Protocol thereto on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment and the Luxembourg Rail Protocol (expected to be in force by the time the GL come into force), which are supposed to provide a robust international framework for the enforcement of creditors' rights over their collateral.

PARAGRAPH_69055: One respondent suggested that enforceability in case of insolvency or bankruptcy, required in paragraph 16 of the consultation paper of the GL (CP hereinafter), is not a systematic and general requirement laid down by the CRR. In the opinion of the respondent, it should not be considered an eligibility criterion applicable to all CRM techniques or in every case, but should only apply where explicitly required by the CRR, i.e. for certain CRM techniques such as (i) on-balance-sheet netting agreements (Article 205 of the CRR) or (ii) master netting agreements for repurchase, securities, or commodities lending or borrowing transactions or other capital-markets-driven transactions as defined in Article 192(3) of the CRR (Article 206 of the CRR).

PARAGRAPH_69071: approach and therefore the 45% single LGD value (prescribed) for financial institutions will disincentivise the use of CRM techniques provided by insurance companies. This regulatory LGD value is considered inadequate since (i) it is not reflective of the reality of this specific CRM tool (as noted in the Fitch Insurer Rating Criteria, recovery rates for policyholders are expected to be well above the ones implied by this value), (ii) it will result in substitution of much higher risk weights and (iii) it will potentially lead to a reduction in lending volumes and trade facilitated by this CRM tool. It was also noted that insurance policies used as CRM tools warrant an enhanced LGD compared with that prescribed in the FIRB approach or indeed observed in direct exposure instances. In this particular case, indirect exposures are in fact more beneficial than direct for all the reasons that set insurers apart from banks (i.e. insurers are not involved in maturity transformation (unlike banks) and are not exposed to sudden losses of confidence or 'runs' and most multi-line insurers are uncorrelated to the credit cycle). In this regard, the respondents welcome further discussion on the introduction of more risk-sensitive LGD values for insurance companies to promote a virtuous circle and incentivise banks to insure their deals with credit protection providers. Furthermore, the revised Basel III framework does not differentiate between the following two cases: (i) exposures to an insurance company as a lender and (ii) beneficiary of an insurance policy provided by the insurer

This opinion intends to complement the previously provided policy advice with additional considerations related to the treatment of credit insurance as a CRM technique for the purpose of the calculation of own funds requirements. With regard to the double default treatment specified in Article 153(3) of the CRR, institutions can currently use this method for recognising the effects of UFCP, as clarified in section 6.2 of the GL.

Two respondents suggested explicitly both (i) better recognising the specificity of insurance exposures in the LGD values prescribed by the regulation or maintaining the A-IRB approach for exposures to credit insurers and (ii) confirming that collateral effects can be assessed independently of the identity of the obligor and reflected as such at the comparable exposure level. One respondent suggested keeping the double default treatment presented in Article 153(3) of the CRR to give preferential treatment to credit insurances.

PARAGRAPH_69085: One respondent pointed out that the clarification of the CRM approaches at which these GL are aimed should be considered jointly with the changes related to the finalisation of Basel III to avoid excessive model volatility within a very short timeframe. One of the main challenges is to achieve the required IRB changes (such as the implementation of these GL) by the 2021 deadline (many of them will become redundant after the implementation of the revised Basel III framework).

An adjustment for regulators alone will not give banks the time needed to combine the Basel III reform and the IRB repair changes to their models. In this vein, several respondents suggested postponing the date of application of the IRB repair measures to the date of application of the revised Basel III framework. In addition, one respondent requested the EBA to prevent competent authorities from bringing forward the date of application of the GL.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:69] [REQ_TYPE:MANDATORY]
PARAGRAPH_69097: should be postponed by one year until the end of 2021 (application date from 1 January 2022). It should be noted that, while the final deadline is postponed, both institutions and competent authorities should follow the original implementation plan where feasible'. Considering the interactions with the final Basel III framework, in the IRB roadmap report report the EBA also acknowledges in paragraph 19 that 'the plans for the implementation of the changes in the rating systems should take into account the upcoming reforms, in line with the revised Basel III framework. In particular, institutions may apply a lower priority to those models that cover portfolios that will no longer be eligible for the AIRB approach under the final Basel III framework. In this specific case, where institutions have stand-alone rating systems for exposures to institutions, financial institutions treated as corporates or large corporates as defined under the final Basel III framework, the deadline for the implementation of the changes in LGD and conversion factors models is postponed until the end of 2023. Within that period, institutions may also choose to apply for permission to return to a less sophisticated IRB approach or for the permanent partial use of the standardised approach for those portfolios, according to Articles 149 and 150 of the CRR.'

In particular, it was deemed necessary to clarify whether the eligibility requirements for the CRM purposes specified in these GL are considered equivalent to the appropriateness requirements for the rating transfer purposes specified in the EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:70] [RISK:CREDIT_RISK]
PARAGRAPH_69111: the treatment of ratings of third parties presented in paragraphs 62 to 64 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation is not considered a method for recognising CRM effects. In particular, the use of the rating transfer specified in paragraph 62(a) is not a substitution of risk parameters due to the existence of CRM and therefore it is not covered by the scope of these GL. Rating transfer and the 'substitution of risk parameters approach' (specified in paragraph 31(a)(ii) of the GL) are different concepts: (i) the first one is a possible manner in which the rating of a third party (with whom the obligor has a contractual or organisational relation) may be taken into account by institutions in the assessment of risk of an obligor whereas (ii) the second one is one of the possible approaches that institutions may use to reduce the credit risk associated with an exposure. Under (i) the obligor may use the support from a third party without any specific action from the institution and this support may prevent the default of the obligor. On the contrary, under (ii) the CRM is realised at the explicit request of the institution and this action triggers the default of the obligor. Under this understanding, there is no direct relation between the eligibility requirements for CRM techniques and the appropriateness of the type of support provided by a third party to an obligor in order to consider a rating transfer.

PARAGRAPH_69123: of input floors and haircuts on A-IRB models proposed by the final Basel III framework is overly punitive, as the formula used to determine the floor considers the haircut according to the FCCM (under the F-IRB approach), hence leading to increasing capital absorption despite better quality collateral. In this context, several respondents asked for a review of the granularity and scope of 'other physical collateral' in order to accommodate specific characteristics of collaterals such as aircraft and ships. They suggested the introduction of a separate collateral type for 'aircraft and ships', with lower regulatory LGD under the F-IRB approach and lower LGD floor under the A-IRB approach, to differentiate them from less liquid collateral such as plants, machinery and equipment. Furthermore, some respondents deemed the eligibility criteria for specialised lending exposures to be overly punitive, as designed for corporate loans. They argued that the eligibility criteria should therefore be adapted to the economic reality of the recovery practices observed in the market.

Nevertheless, it should be noted that 'Recommendation CR-IR 13: LGD input floors' presented in the CfA report clarifies that 'the haircuts used for calculation of the individual LGD input floors for secured and partially secured exposures should be based on the eligibility criteria of the A-IRB Approach'. However, the final Basel III framework does not introduce any ad hoc haircut values for the LGD input floors for collaterals such as aircraft and ships.

In particular, given that institutions applying the A-IRB approach may sometimes wish to structure their UFCP in line with the eligibility requirements of Chapter 4, it would be helpful if the EBA could confirm that compliance with the UFCP eligibility criteria under Chapter 4 is sufficient to treat the UFCP as eligible under the A- IRB approach. In addition, one respondent asked whether the fulfilment of the Chapter 4 eligibility requirements would automatically mean that the UFCP is unconditional.

In this respect, being in line with the eligibility requirements for UFCP of Chapter 4 would ensure compliance with eligibility requirements for UFCP of Chapter 3 as well as with the principles presented in paragraphs 24 and 25 of the GL. Furthermore, as conditional UFCP is not permitted under the F-IRB approach and the SA, if an institution fulfils the requirements for UFCP for these approaches, this means that the UFCP is unconditional.

PARAGRAPH_69163: A couple of respondents expressed their agreement with the GL. They welcomed the general alignment of the SA and the IRB approach in terms of eligibility requirements (in particular regarding the collateral valuation), as well as exempting the requirements around property insurance for collateral. Other respondents generally criticised the notion of eligibility, not only because too strict eligibility criteria for some collaterals would be difficult to meet in practice, but also because the LGD models and their outcomes can capture the lower quality of this credit protection (via the lower observed cash flows). The respondents pointed out in

PARAGRAPH_69164: In order to recognise the effects of CRM techniques in own funds requirements, institutions have to meet minimum eligibility criteria. However, as specified in Article 181(1)(f) of the CRR, under the A-IRB approach these eligibility criteria are less strict than those applicable under the SA and the F-IRB approach. This already takes into account the increased risk sensitivity of LGD models compared with less sophisticated approaches.

PARAGRAPH_69177: The EBA notes that the terminology 'reasonable timeframe' is the one used in Articles 208 and 210 of the CRR, and is necessary to establish whether a credit protection arrangement is legally effective and enforceable. Conversely, the EBA agrees with the respondent regarding the interpretation of the word 'also', i.e. it does not refer to the cases of a custodian insolvency only. In particular, in accordance with Article 194(4) of the CRR, it is clarified in the background and rationale that the collateral should always be effective when necessary, even in the case of custodian insolvency.

In the respondent's view, it should be clarified that there is no need for an institution to be able to retain assets in the sole event of a custodian insolvency or default (i.e. if the obligor is still performing) but rather the requirement is that the assets are bankruptcy remote to the custodian.

In particular, the meaning of 'other types of exposures' and 'other obligors' should be clarified, since according to the CP a new legal opinion seems to be required for any new borrower. Another respondent pointed out that transaction- specific opinions should be considered the exception rather than the rule. While the clarifications provided in the GL recognise the possibility of a generic opinion (single opinions for multiple collateral arrangements), they may give

PARAGRAPH_69262: Institutions are required to obtain an additional legal opinion any time a substantive variation of the terms of the collateral arrangement has an impact on the effectiveness and enforceability of the collateral. Changes in the type of obligor covered by the UFCP are always considered cases of substantive variation. It was not intended to require a separate legal opinion for every borrower and the GL are modified accordingly. Moreover, the EBA does not limit the use of legal opinions covering multiple collateral arrangements, as long as they meet the requirements specified in the GL. As an additional remark, the GL do not require a separate legal opinion for each jurisdiction but they allow institutions to rely on a single legal opinion covering several jurisdictions. For this purpose, institutions may use international regulations, which have been adopted to ensure the effectiveness and enforceability of specific types of collaterals.

PARAGRAPH_69274: The reference in paragraph 20(a) of the CP to the jurisdiction where the obligor is incorporated was deemed irrelevant by several respondents because enforceability of the collateral could be sufficiently ensured by a legal opinion on the law of the state in which the institution is located and, if relevant, by the assessment of the third country law. Other respondents considered that the reference in paragraph 20(a) of the CP to the jurisdiction where the lender is incorporated was irrelevant because enforceability is independent from the law of the lending institution but, if different, is related to the jurisdiction of the obligor and the registration country of the collateral. Furthermore, one respondent proposed clarifying the notion of 'obligor', which should be interpreted as the owner of the asset (namely the collateral), since the owner of the asset would grant the interest under the collateral agreement in favour of the institution (as creditor). Concerning paragraph 20(c) of the CP, two respondents

PARAGRAPH_69275: The EBA recognises that assessing legal certainty for some types of collateral could be challenging. The principles with regard to obtaining a legal opinion were revised to reduce burden and unjustified costs for institutions but ensure a sufficient level of legal certainty. Regarding the jurisdictions considered relevant for other physical collateral, the strict approach originally proposed in paragraphs 20 and 21 of the CP is replaced by a more practical approach. The list is now more flexible, specifying a minimum set of jurisdictions that institutions should take into account when assessing legal certainty. In particular, the jurisdiction of the obligor and the one where the lending institution is incorporated may not always be considered relevant but institutions should evaluate their relevance. Paragraph 20(c) of the CP (paragraph 23(b) in the GL) was drafted in a more general way to recognise the possibility that a public register for the collateral does not exist. In addition, paragraph 20(d) of the CP has been removed and instead paragraph 23(d) of the GL requires institutions to provide a legal opinion for the

The requirements in paragraph 21(b) and/or 20(d) of the CP were deemed too burdensome by the majority of the respondents. It has been highlighted that considering legal certainty in numerous jurisdictions would create huge constraints and costs for both borrowers and lenders. Moreover, they stated that these provisions are against market practices, which do not prescribe a limited set of jurisdictions, but it is more common to specify in the contracts in which jurisdictions the asset may not be operated. Finally, respondents argued that obtaining legal opinions for all the jurisdictions listed in the CP would not increase legal certainty. Indeed, institutions have systems that allow them to track the position of movable collaterals and they enforce the collateral only when it is located in a favourable jurisdiction.

This assessment could be based, for example, on contractual clauses or institutions' experience with regard to liquidation of similar types of collateral. Finally, paragraph 23(e) of the GL introduces a residual category of any other relevant jurisdiction considered important to ensure legal certainty of the specific collateral. In accordance with Article 181(e) of the CRR, the GL clarify that, for other physical collateral, institutions should consider and appropriately reflect in their LGD estimates any potential inability to enforce the collateral because of their movable nature.

PARAGRAPH_69341: Inclusion of collaterals in
LGD estimation

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:83]
PARAGRAPH_69343: Many respondents expressed concern regarding the way the explanatory box was drafted. In particular, they pointed out that some models do not directly reflect the effect of collaterals in the LGD estimates. These respondents were concerned about the strict interpretation of this explanation, which seems not to reflect the widely used commercial recovery process where a customer- level approach is followed. They commented that: a) where a customer-level approach is used it is unnecessarily complex to separate recoveries for each individual type of collateral, whether eligible or ineligible, as it would not reflect the commercial reality; b) the effect of collateral cannot, in many situations, be isolated from the other recovery flows in the event of default of the customer. Therefore, requiring the possibility to model directly the effect of collaterals on LGD (such as via a decomposition of the secured and unsecured LGD) would impose the application of the F-IRB approach on the large number of secured exposures. Therefore, both a national and an EU banking association advocated that the revised CRR should confirm full latitude to institutions to model the effects of collaterals under the A-IRB approach, by removing any limitation to the modelling of

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:83]
PARAGRAPH_69344: For A-IRB institutions, the only way to recognise the existence of collateral (other than MNA or OBSN) is through modelling the LGD estimates. In this respect, guidance on how this type of FCP should be recognised in the institutions' LGD estimates was already provided in section 6 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation. In particular, regardless of the recovery process followed by institutions, paragraph 114 of those guidelines requires that 'Institutions should take reasonable steps to recognise the sources of the cash flows and allocate them adequately to the specific collateral or unfunded credit protection that has been realised. Where the source of the cash flows cannot be identified, institutions should specify clear policies for the treatment and allocation of such recovery cash flows, which should not lead to a bias in LGD estimation.' Furthermore, section 6.2.3 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation presents the main principles that institutions need to fulfil in order to appropriately reflect the effect of collaterals in the LGD estimates (without prescribing any specific methodology) and, in particular, it is not required that institutions need to decompose the LGD estimates into the secured and unsecured components. Paragraph 105 of those GL reads as follows: 'Institutions should be able to demonstrate that the methods that they choose for the purpose of LGD estimation are appropriate to their activities and the type of exposures to which the estimates apply ...

PARAGRAPH_69408: One of the concerns expressed by the industry entails the treatment of exposures risk weighted under the SA or the F-IRB approach and covered by a guarantee where the direct exposures to the guarantor are treated under the A-IRB approach. In particular, the industry questioned whether the 'substitution of risk parameters approach' (specified in paragraph 29(a)(ii) of the CP) was applicable and whether institutions should follow the requirements for the recognition of the credit protection relevant for the A-IRB approach (i.e. Chapter 3) or the ones from Chapter 4.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:86]
PARAGRAPH_69409: In accordance with Article 108 of the CRR, the treatment of CRM techniques and, in particular, UFCP for exposures risk weighted under the SA or the F-IRB approach should follow Chapter 4 independently from the approach used for direct exposures to the guarantor. In particular, where the original exposure is treated under the SA, the substitution can be used in accordance with Article 235 of the CRR (and paragraph 1 of this article is clear that the risk weight of the protection provider is the one specified under Chapter 2). Consequently, the requirements for the recognition of the credit protection can only be the ones used for the SA. Where the original exposure is treated under the F- IRB approach, the effects of UFCP can be recognised in accordance with Article 236 of the CRR.

PARAGRAPH_69419: Some respondents asked how to take into account UFCP for the supervisory slotting approach. They pointed out that the CRR is silent on whether UFCP (other than those already specified in the slotting approach, such as completion guarantees or guarantees provided by public entities in public- private partnership projects) can be recognised for specialised lending exposures treated under the slotting approach. Regarding ECA guarantees that effectively convert the guaranteed exposure to ECA or sovereign risk, clarification was requested on how their impact can be reflected in the slotting approach. The respondents commented that, while the framework allows this to be done only through PD and LGD adjustments, under the slotting approach there is no PD/LGD to adjust. They suggested that this could potentially be addressed by tranching the exposure in the context of ECA guarantees and risk-weighting the guaranteed portion using the PD and LGD of the eligible guarantor (and using the slotting approach only for the unguaranteed portion of the exposure). In addition, they suggested enhancing the granularity of the slotting approach by allowing other risk mitigation techniques to be better reflected in the risk weights. The respondents also noted that in footnote 3 of the high-level summary of the Basel III reforms, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision

One respondent suggested considering the eligibility criteria only in the application (and not in the estimation) of risk parameters. Moreover, it has been pointed out that when eligibility criteria are not met, in some cases, the collaterals that are not eligible might however have a material positive impact on the level of the realised LGD. Additional clarification is requested on the appropriate approach to properly take into account such cash flows while correcting the associated biases in accordance with paragraph 127 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation (to avoid systematic overestimation of the LGD estimated for the unguaranteed part of the exposure).

The respondent also asked if the cash flows from ineligible UFCP should be allowed to be included with unsecured recovery cash flows (having in mind, in particular, cash flows received from general securities, which do not meet the eligibility criteria but might have a material positive impact on the level of realised LGD).

The treatment of ineligible UFCP specified in these GL is consistent with the treatment of ineligible FCP specified in the EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation. Where cash flows from ineligible guarantees are included in the reference data set used for LGD estimation, the amounts and frequency of such cash flows have to be monitored and, where necessary, the estimates have to be adjusted to avoid potential bias. However, EBA acknowledges that the issue needs clarification and the CRM framework would benefit from an overall review in the context of the implementation of the final Basel III in the EU (see recommendation CR-IR 27 of the CfA report).

Furthermore, the requirement that costs are negligible ensures that there is no significant underestimation of losses in the case of guarantees implying high costs of collection. Since costs cannot be taken into account under the 'substitution of risk parameters approach', they should be reflected in the 'modelling approach' (specified in paragraph 31(a)(i) of the GL).

PARAGRAPH_69524: This clarification, relevant where institutions adopt the 'substitution of risk parameters approach' (specified in paragraph 31(a)(ii) of the GL), was added to paragraph 39 of the GL and further clarified in the background and rationale section. The classification of exposures as defaulted should be performed in accordance with the status of the obligor and regardless of the approach used to recognise the UFCP. As long the definition of default is applied at obligor level and the obligor is non- defaulted, the exposure should also be considered non-defaulted. Conversely, in all cases where the obligor defaulted, including where the 'substitution of risk parameters approach' is used, the exposure should be allocated to the portfolio of defaulted exposures. This clarification is provided in the GL in the context of the calculation of the IRB shortfall or

It ensures consistency of the comparison between the expected loss and credit risk adjustments, given that, under the accounting framework, exposures from defaulted obligors will normally be recognised as impaired, regardless of the existence of any credit risk mitigation technique. Nevertheless, under the 'substitution of risk parameters approach', if the obligor has defaulted but the guarantor is still performing, the risk weight and expected loss of the guaranteed part of the exposure should be those of the direct, comparable exposure to the non-defaulted guarantor. Therefore, when comparing with the amount of credit risk adjustments, institutions should use the substituted EL amount of the comparable direct exposure to the guarantor, and no further specific estimation of the expected loss best estimate is necessary.

They consider that the current approach in place within banks for the back-testing of credit risk parameters (applicable to guarantors and obligors) would ensure that the estimates stay robust to additional historical data. Furthermore, back-testing the 'substitution approach' would be difficult because UFCP is very often provided by financial institutions or sovereign counterparties, which are exposure types with a low number of default observations.

The respondents suggested that the comparison between the obligor LGD and the guarantor LGD without FCP should be dropped and that banks should always be allowed to use the obligor LGD to recognise FCP. They argued that the treatment is unduly punitive in the case of financial institutions, which will in the future be F-IRB guarantors and will be a strong issue when applying the final Basel III framework (due to the migration to the F-IRB approach). It was therefore argued that the condition will never be fulfilled, and banks will not be able to use the LGD estimates of the original exposure to the obligor including the effect of the FCP. The EBA was urged to allow a more accurate treatment, i.e. to use the LGD applicable to the obligor taking into account the FCP, without condition.

If there is no or low correlation between insurance providers and obligors, a conservative adjustment is not necessary, but a positive adjustment should be ruled out in all cases.

PARAGRAPH_69593: One respondent expressed doubts regarding the proposed rules for the treatment of multiple CRM techniques (i.e. multiple UFCP or FCP/UFCP), considering them too strict and penalising, since they create a limitation in the recognition of CRM techniques even if institutions have empirical evidence of the effect of them on the LGD estimates. The respondent proposed that the LGD own estimates should be based on the internal track-record of cash flows recorded by institutions.

[JURISDICTION:EU] [SOURCE:EBA] [CATEGORY:FINANCIAL_REGULATION] [PAGE:98]
PARAGRAPH_69594: Where institutions adopt the 'modelling approach' (specified in paragraph 31(a)(i) of the GL), they are free to consider the effect of CRM techniques in their LGD own estimates according to their internal assessment based on historical observations of the institution. However, for the 'substitution of risk parameters approach' (specified in paragraph 31(a)(ii) of the GL) and the calculation of the risk weight floor (in accordance with Article 161(3) of the CRR), clear rules are necessary to avoid undue RWA variability. With regard to the allocation of UFCP, the EBA expects that this should be consistent with institutions' internal policies on collection and recovery processes, taking into account in particular the order of realising different elements of credit protection. The strategy of institutions for the allocation of UFCP should also be consistent over time. The background and rationale section was enhanced taking into account the received feedback.

According to two respondents, this would imply that A-IRB institutions would not be able to recognise UFCP on most specialised lending exposures that also benefit from FCP, since the loss experience on exposures to guarantors secured by the very same type of collateral is potentially limited. Furthermore, they argued that

If this is not possible based on the LGD model applicable to exposures to the guarantor, institutions may use the alternative solutions set out in paragraph 47 of the GL.

PARAGRAPH_69649: exposure to the guarantor, no harmonisation on the way of calculating the floor is necessary. Finally, one respondent highlighted also that the GL do not address the interpretation of the word 'comparable' in the definition of the risk weight floor. In particular, if the transaction benefits from multiple CRM techniques, it is not clear if a comparable transaction would be then by consequence a secured transaction.

PARAGRAPH_69650: calculation of the risk weight floor, the LGD of a comparable direct exposure to the guarantor may consider the effect of the other existing CRM techniques.

PARAGRAPH_69651: Question 12. Do you consider portfolio guarantees as a form of eligible UFCP? Do they include cases where the guarantee contract sets a materiality threshold on portfolio losses below or above which no payment shall be made by the guarantor? Do they include cases where two or more thresholds (caps) either expressed in percentages or in currency units are set to limit the maximum obligation under the guarantee? How do you recognise the portfolio guarantees' credit risk mitigation effects in adjusting risk parameters?

PARAGRAPH_69652: Three respondents considered that the effect of the UFCP schemes described in the CP should be independent of the eligibility rules applicable to the guarantor, and the UFCP schemes should be used on both SA and IRB portfolios.

PARAGRAPH_69654: Two respondents pointed out that, while they do not recognise portfolio guarantees in the sense detailed in the text, there is a range of 'scheme' guarantees where the government or European authorities provide partial backing for specific loans granted under the terms of the schemes that should be regarded as eligible UFCP.

PARAGRAPH_69656: The EBA discussed the concerns raised by the respondents and agreed that the treatment of portfolio guarantees should be considered in a comprehensive manner for all approaches, and not exclusively for the A-IRB approach. Therefore, in order to avoid any potential unintended inconsistencies, the issue is not included in the scope of the GL. Instead, the necessary clarification should be provided through a Q&A, consistently applied to all approaches.

PARAGRAPH_69665: Article 4(1) of the CRR). In fact, when the guarantee is provided to a portfolio of loans, the occurred loss of a single loan does not imply the termination of the risk mitigation effects, because the contractual guarantee continues to be operative and effective until its legal maturity (which must not be shorter than the weighted average life of the covered portfolio). One respondent stated that it is not clear whether all types of capped portfolio guarantees that transfer a part of the risk of a loan in one or more tranches (in accordance with Article 234 of the CRR) can be recognised as eligible UFCP.
